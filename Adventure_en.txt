2162688	Barracuda Piers	"Under the azure, I gazed down upon warships three, their billowing sails of crimson leaving no doubt as to who truly rules the seas." Such were the merchant's words, and I would see as he saw.	These docks provide safe mooring for the Thalassocratic Navy's principal squadrons, also known as the Crimson Fleet. To prevent sabotage, admittance to the area is forbidden to the general citizenry; however, on clear days, one may catch a glimpse of the armada flagship, the \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03Triumph\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03, from atop one of Limsa Lominsa's myriad spans.	4876856	27	81501	81001	81451	800	1159	22	1
2162689	The \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03Astalicia\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03	"A flagon or two o' grog havin' filled me 'ead with big ideas, I eyed that 'ive o' villainy from the pier, feelin' as if I could cut down One-eyed Hyllfyr 'imself. Woke the next mornin' strung up by me ankles. Aye, was lucky to escape with me life." Such were the buccaneer's words, and I would see as he saw.	Registered as a trade vessel hailing from foreign waters, this battle-scarred warship captained by the lord of the region's underworld, One-eyed Hyllfyr, serves as a gathering place for brigands, cutthroats, and the purveyors of sundry other breeds of villainy. It is here that the city-state's many pirate crews find new recruits to join their ranks.	4876859	27	81502	81002	81451	1800	459	22	1
2162690	Seasong Grotto	"In a dank cavern that's never known the sun, the patter of the rain me only companion, I dropped to one knee and said me farewells to me ill-fated mates. They sing no songs for fishermen, but the sea swallows us all the same." Such were the old mariner's words, and I would see as he saw.	\xe2\x80\x9cI am the waves that bear, I am the winds that guide.\x02\x10\x01\x03I am the evening stars, I am the morning sky.\x02\x10\x01\x03I am born of the sea, and there shall I die.\xe2\x80\x9d\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03Nestled within a shallow cavern situated to the south of Summerford Farms sits an ancient monolith upon which is carved this, the Sailors' Requiem.	4876905	30	81503	81003	81451	500	759	58	1
2162691	The Skylift	"Backbreakin', arse-bustin' work, it is. But seein' me vessels ridin' the winds, soarin' off to far lands where me legs will never carry me\xe2\x94\x80well, at least me sweat and blood ain't been for naught, eh?" Such were the laborer's words, and I would see as he saw.	Once an endless expanse of flat, rocky meadows, lower La Noscea is now severed atwain by a sheer cliff known as the Descent. To maintain overland trade routes from the easterly outposts of Aleport and Bronze Lake, Lominsan engineers created the Skylift\xe2\x94\x80a tower of wooden scaffolding outfitted with pulleys, winches, and lighter-than-air balloons.	4876907	30	81504	81004	81451	1200	1659	22	1
2162692	La Thagran Eastroad	"When the skies turn grey and spirits sag, I climb high and look upon roads blazed long ago. I turn my thoughts to the hardships of my forebears till mine own worries drift away, and I find strength to carry on." Such were the sentry's words, and I would see as she saw.	When the \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03Galadion\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 fell victim to the Navigator's fury and ran aground on the southern shores of Vylbrand seven hundred years ago, it was her two helmsmen, Jean De Nevelle and Guy La Thagran, who were tasked with exploring the newfound island\xe2\x94\x80the former heading east, the latter, west. To this day, their routes still serve as La Noscea's two main thoroughfares.	4876912	30	81505	81005	81451	800	1159	22	1
2162693	The Salt Strand	"Under the watchful gaze of the Wanderer, I cast a line to waters far below. Looking upon those pillars, grotesque and beautiful, my thoughts drift to that fateful day five years ago." Such were the fisher's words, and I would see as she saw.	When struck by a fallen shard from Dalamud's outer shell, a massive amount of concentrated aether was released from just below the surface of the Rhotano Sea, immediately fusing with and crystallizing the towering fount of salt water which was expelled during the impact. City-state-funded exploratory forays into the inner crater have all yet to return...	4876920	31	81508	81008	81451	1800	459	22	1
2162694	Red Rooster Stead	"No romance in the farmin' life? Balderdash, I say! Rise at dawn, climb atop the gate, and look upon the dew-kissed fields below\xe2\x94\x80then tell me there's any place in the realm ye'd rather be." Such were the farmer's words, and I would see as he saw.	The farmers on the Red Rooster Stead will rarely shy from testing their agricultural acumen on exotic crops or untested growing methods, and take pride in their willingness to sacrifice a harvest if it means a better yield an autumn hence. The plantation's name is said to be taken from the bloody cockfights held after nightfall by the gamekeeps.	4876921	31	81509	81009	81451	500	759	22	1
2162695	Brewer's Beacon	"When dawn breaks, I quench the flame and pour meself an ale. I step outside, and lose meself in the blue expanse above and below\xe2\x94\x80me hard-earned reward for the ships I've seen to safety, I reckon." Such were the candlekeep's words, and I would see as he saw.	This relatively new lighthouse was built soon after the Calamity claimed Swiftperch Tower to ensure safe passage for trade vessels carrying shipments of dark stouts and blonde barleywines out of Aleport. In addition, the candlekeeps also keep watch for increasingly frequent rogue tidal waves caused by the stirrings of the Lord of the Whorl.	4876926	33	81513	81013	81451	500	759	22	1
2162696	The Leatherworkers' Guild	"Knew it was my calling ever since I was knee-high to a goobbue. When cloudy days sunk my spirits, I'd sneak into the guild, climb as high as my legs could carry me, and watch the tanners and tawers at work below." Such were the craftsman's words, and I would see as he saw.	Crafters for the realm-famous Atelier Fen-Yll, the Leatherworkers' Guild boasts the finest tawers and tanners in all Eorzea. In recent years, the workshop has come to be known for its Geva patterns, which outline methods of working and cutting hides, pelts, skins, and furs in a way that honors the elementals within by minimizing waste.	4868036	51	81552	81052	81452	1200	1659	22	1
2162697	Apkallu Falls	"My favoritest place is where I can see the falling water. There's a secret path that only I know. I snuck out of bed to go there last night. Mum and Dad made me promise I wouldn't climb up there anymore\xe2\x94\x80you won't tell them, will you?" Such were the little boy's words, and I would see as he saw.	Named after a failed attempt by an ambitious Gridanian merchant to hatch and breed apkallus in the linn, Apkallu Falls is most remembered for serving as a place of meditation for the late Louisoix Leveilleur, Circle of Knowing Archon and hero of Eorzea.	4876928	51	81553	81053	81452	1800	459	22	1
2162698	Bentbranch Meadows	"Cute little bugger, isn't he? The moogle, that is. Seein' him up there on a clear day, swayin' gently in the wind, it's enough to lull a man to slumber. Me, I settle for a stump and a moment's repose." Such were the stablehand's words, and I would see as he saw.	Once Moogle's Gift Mounts was established and its rookery stocked with Ishgard's finest birds, it was not long before an entire settlement had grown up around the stables. The trademark balloon tethered to the main building is actually an Ixali war vessel claimed by chocobokeeps after it became tangled in a nearby tree and was abandoned by its riders.	4877070	54	81555	81055	81452	1200	1659	52	1
2162699	The Sanctum of the Twelve	"I've never been the pious type, but when the sun strikes those windows and the trees in the gardens glisten, even I find myself mouthing a prayer from time to time." Such were the botanist's words, and I would see as he saw.	This sky-scraping ivory cathedral was built following the Age of Endless Frost\xe2\x94\x80a dark period in which the realm was overrun with famine and disease\xe2\x94\x80to serve as a place of refuge and respite for all who sought succor. Soon after, however, it fell into ruin and was all but forgotten...until the advent of the Seventh Umbral Era saw need for its rise once again.	4877071	55	81560	81060	81452	800	1159	58	1
2162700	Little Solace	"To know the sylph, you must be the sylph. I may lack for wings, but a short climb will put me in a similar position. Lights dancing in the dark before me, I ponder what mischief I might make\xe2\x94\x80er, were I a sylph, that is." Such were the scholar's words, and I would see as he saw.	Little is the solace granted to those sylphs who would voice their opposition to the summoning of the Lord of Levin. Little is the solace bequeathed upon those who would abandon their homes in the Sylphlands and shun their frenzied brethren. Thus, it is only through fraternity that those sylphs may ultimately find solace, however little it may be.	4877072	55	81561	81061	81452	1800	459	22	1
2162701	Royal Promenade	"Come morning, when my watch is over, I stand upon the three plates of silver depicting the first three of our kind. Paying reverence to those who came before us, I salute my sworn brothers who stand before me." Such were the Sultansworn's words, and I would see as he saw.	In times when the sultan had sole rule over the city-state, the Promenade would serve as an ersatz waiting chamber for those petitioners who sought audience with His Resplendence in the Fragrant Chamber. Now, with power in the hands of the Syndicate, the round is empty, save for the occasional tryst betwixt young nobles.	4877073	39	81601	81101	81453	500	759	31	1
2162702	The Gold Court	"Even the strings of the tightest purse loosen upon seeing my famed balancing act. From vaulted gardens I leap onto the eastmost streetlamp, then bask as dour, cloudy expressions break into smiles and a shower of gil." Such were the acrobat's words, and I would see as he saw.	A large atrium in the heart of Ul'dah, the Gold Court's opulence and scale make it a popular meeting place for the city's elite. The plaza was once reserved for the sultan's private balls, but has since been opened to the public due to a lack of funds to maintain the majestic hanging fountain at her center.	4877074	39	81602	81102	81453	1200	1659	22	1
2162703	The Jewel of the Desert	"From a vantage point high above Nophica's Wells, I looked out upon Ul'dah in all its glory\xe2\x94\x80truly a jewel in the desert, shining brighter than a sea of stars." Such were the adventurer's words, and I would see as she saw.	The commercial hub of Ul'dah is organized strategically around the dome-shaped citadel at its center. Its towering fortifications and protective outer walls bedighted with myriad glass panes and colorful mosaics are visible for malms in all directions, and serve as a stark yet dazzling deterrent to would-be besiegers.	4877077	42	81603	81103	81453	1800	459	22	1
2162704	The Ruins of Sil'dih	"The fog was so thick you could cut it with a blade. My foot slipped, and in an eyeblink I was sprawled out on a cliff, the ruins of a buried city before me. Sadly, the stinging pain in my arse detracted somewhat from my enjoyment of the scenery." Such were the adventurer's words, and I would see as he saw.	The city-states of Ul'dah and Sil'dih coexisted for generations until four hundred years ago when bad blood festering betwixt the two sultanates culminated in the War of the Sisters\xe2\x94\x80leaving Sil'dih a smoldering pile of rubble to be claimed by the shifting desert sands. The subsequent relocation of Ul'dah placed the city-state nearly directly above her fallen sibling.	4877078	43	81606	81106	81453	800	1159	22	1
2162705	The Lonely Giant	"Merciful are the rains that fall, for they give succor to the thirsting land, and comfort the old wounds of one who journeyed too far from home." Such were the botanist's words, and I would see as she saw.	Local legend claims the Lonely Giant is everything from the ghost of a Sil'dihn sultan, to the prototype for a new model of Garlean machina. Ul'dahn scholars, however, simply believe him a Coerthan goobbue who lost his bearings during the chaos of the Calamity, and after a long journey through the Black Shroud, died of exhaustion upon reaching Thanalan.	4877079	44	81609	81109	81453	1700	1759	9	1
2162706	The Invisible City	"As I felled my quarry atop a great stone slab, my eyes drifted up to a city swallowed by the clouds and the mountain itself. I know not who once called it home, nor why it fell, but it was a sight to behold." Such were the adventurer's words, and I would see as he saw.	Buried under nearly a malm of solid rock, if not for a gaping rent torn open by the Calamity, these ancient ruins may have gone undiscovered for another thousand summers. Scholars sent to Highbridge to study the site are currently of a mind that the structures are not a city, but in fact the tomb of one Lalafuto IV, famed sultan of Belah'dia.	4877081	44	81610	81110	81453	800	1159	22	1
2162707	Highbridge	"En route from Ul'dah to Gridania, I sought lodgings at Highbridge. Setting out at first light, I looked out upon the wise men of old\xe2\x94\x80at least they looked wiser than me\xe2\x94\x80and asked for guidance in my travels." Such were the merchant's words, and I would see as he saw.	After the Calamity rent eastern Thanalan asunder, one of the first projects commissioned by the Syndicate was the construction of a bridge to span the newly formed chasm and restore the trade route with lands transpontine. The city which has sprung up along its edges is populated almost solely by scholars investigating the nearby ruins of the Invisible City.	4877082	44	81611	81111	81453	500	759	58	1
2162708	Woad Whisper Canyon	"Don't tell Baderon, but if ye ask me, ye'll find no better place to down a flagon of ale than where the water dances, keepin' ye cool on even the 'ottest summer's day." Such were the laborer's words, and I would see as he saw.	Little more than a shallow valley but five years past, Woad Whisper Canyon was carved into a gaping gorge in a matter of moons after the Calamity drained Bronze Lake and dramatically altered the course of the Nym River. On hot days, laborers from both Summerford Farms and the Skylift will oft take respite in the cool mists of the falls...if not met by bandits.	4877083	30	81506	81006	81451	1200	1659	22	0
2162709	Summerford Farms	Overheard at a tavern: "Erstwhile pirates taken to land, drunk on ale and tales of wenches and plunder, climb atop lamps as if they were manning the crow's nest of a great vessel..."	When Merlwyb Bloefhiswyn rose to Admiral, one of her first decrees included the clearing of large swathes of land for new Lominsan settlements. Summerford Farms and its expansive orange groves is one of those locations\xe2\x94\x80its name is derived from the man-made crossings required when late spring runoff from Mt. O'Ghomoro causes the Rogue River to swell.	4877084	30	81507	81007	81451	500	759	22	0
2162710	The Grey Fleet	"I took refuge inside to get away from the rain. To my ill fortune, the beastmen had the same idea. Quickly, I climbed to the roof and plotted a course of escape. Quite a view, though staying alive was a far more pressing concern at the time." Such were the merchant's words, and I would see as he saw.	Sitting high atop Widow Cliffs on the southeastern coast of Vylbrand, the Grey Fleet was built to harness the constant southerly winds funneled down through the Strait of Merlthor, and use them to power the many mills which grind the region's wheat and full its wool.	4877085	31	81510	81010	81451	1200	1659	22	0
2162711	Hidden Falls	"The ogling from the men as they recline burns brighter than the summer sun. I don't mind much, provided they're handsome...and wealthy doesn't hurt either." Such were the young lady's words, and I would see as she saw.	Sheltered on three sides by towering cliffs, Hidden Falls can be found several score yalms upstream from where the Agelyss River empties into the Strait of Merlthor. Taken by its beauty, Ul'dahn plutocrat Gegeruju was quick to purchase the land and construct a stage upon which private performances for the magnate's favored clients are held.	4877087	32	81511	81011	81451	800	1159	50	0
2162712	Gullperch Tower	"The rains may cloud our view, but they won't stop those who would invade our shores. And so we climb high, scouring the horizon for any sign of danger." Such were the lookout's words, and I would see as he saw.	One of three beacons built along the La Noscean coast in the Sixth Astral Era, Gullperch Tower is the easternmost\xe2\x94\x80warning ships navigating the Strait of Merlthor of its deadly shallows, while also serving as a watchtower for pirate and Sahagin raids on Bloodshore.	4877088	32	81512	81012	81451	1800	459	22	0
2162713	The Navigator	"I've no wife, an' no mind to take one\xe2\x94\x80the only child I'll ever know is the ale I brew. And so, as the cargo ships pull out of the harbor, I say a prayer to the watcher of seas, that She'll see me sons safe to someone's belly somewhere." Such were the brewer's words, and I would see as he saw.	Carved centuries past by a famous Roegadyn sculptor, this massive stone effigy located in the center of Aleport's lower plaza serves as hallowed ground upon which sailors might offer solemn prayers to the watcher of the seas before embarking on their journeys across the untamed deep. 	4877089	33	81514	81014	81451	1700	1759	58	0
2162714	The Ship Graveyard	"If yer wise, ye won't look too closely. It's not just flotsam the dark tides drag in, and there are sights what could haunt the bravest of men for life. Aye, ye'll not catch me dead going there\xe2\x94\x80least of all at night." Such were the lighthouse keeper's words, and I would see as he saw.	For centuries, ships wrecked off the shores of southern Vylbrand have been carried upon currents to this quiet inlet\xe2\x94\x80a timeless reminder of the Deep's boundless wrath. So many are the wooden corpses which populate this watery lichyard, it is said that for every hull visible above the waves, a score more slumber beneath.	4877090	33	81515	81015	81451	1800	459	22	0
2162715	Camp Skull Valley	Overheard at an inn: "There's an outpost with quite a view of the land, but you'll want to steel yourself well if you mean to go there..."	Now a strategic outpost for the Maelstrom, Camp Skull Valley was once but a circle of tents occupied by a meager Yellowjacket unit charged with surveilling the area for kobold incursions. Those beastmen foolish enough to venture down from O'Ghomoro were slaughtered and beheaded\xe2\x94\x80their skulls put on display as a warning to others.	4877091	33	81516	81016	81451	800	1159	22	0
2162716	Tidegate	Overheard at an alehouse: "When I've misplaced my goods, I climb atop the tents and scour the ground below. Offers a clear view, and you'd be surprised at how sturdy they are..."	Taking advantage of the chaos left in the Calamity's wake, a large force of Sahagin rose from the seas and laid claim to Halfstone, a distant Lominsan settlement on the far-western edge of La Noscea. To prevent any further swells of the beastman forces, a massive wall was erected between the enemy-occupied lowlands and the allied Skull Valley.	4877092	33	81517	81017	81451	1200	1659	22	0
2162717	Camp Bronze Lake	Overheard at a tavern: "Nothing like feeling the cool breeze on your skin after a hot bath. The view's nothin' to sneeze at, either..."	The formation of great underwater fissures during the Calamity saw nearly half of the water comprising Bronze Lake vanish in the span of a single night. The result was the uncovering of ancient Nymian ruins submerged for thousands of years\xe2\x94\x80most notably, the Wanderer's Palace, a temple dedicated to the god Oschon.	4877099	34	81518	81018	81451	1700	1759	22	0
2162718	Thalaos	"Under the burning sun, I climbed to the tip of the ancient one and turned my thoughts to the days when it roamed the deep. This was when inspiration struck..." Such were the scholar's words, and I would see as she saw.	Though there is no proof to support the claim, rumor has these sun-bleached remains of a long-dead denizen of the deep are those of one of the legendary twin sea serpents believed to have been unleashed by the Navigator, Llymlaen, at the dawn of eras to fill the empty seas (the other being Perykos).	4877101	34	81519	81019	81451	1200	1659	22	0
2162719	Jijiroon's Trading Post	Overheard at a tavern: "Spent the night on that ledge, I did\xe2\x94\x80anything to escape those shelled monstrosities. Wasn't a bad sight, though I can't say I enjoyed the trip down..."	Located on the western banks of Bronze Lake, Jijiroon's Trading Post is one of two makeshift markets peddling baubles and trinkets to those brave enough to venture that deep into kobold lands. The other is Memeroon's trading post, run by Jijiroon's estranged sibling, to whom the stubborn Qiqirn merchant hasn't spoken in twenty summers.	4877103	34	81520	81020	81451	1800	459	22	0
2162720	The Floating City of Nym	"There were islands floating in the sky, and crystals that shone like terrestrial stars. Even now, I wonder if it was but a dream..." Such were the fledgling adventurer's words, and I would see as she saw.	Suspended high above the foothills of Mt. O'Ghomoro is the Floating City of Nym\xe2\x94\x80central hub of a lost civilization which prospered on Vylbrand during the Fifth Astral Era. The accepted theory as to how the city was torn from the realm involves the over-aspecting of corrupted wind crystals\xe2\x94\x80a phenomenon witnessed late in the Sixth Astral Era.	4877105	350	81521	81021	81451	1800	459	22	0
2162721	Camp Overlook	Overheard at an inn: "You'll want to keep a wide berth of brigands and beastmen both. There's a crumbling gate, overrun by shrubbery. Makes for good cover, and offers an unobstructed view of the road below\xe2\x94\x80two birds with one stone."	Manned by the \xe2\x80\x9cmeanest shite-kickin' unit in the whole damn Maelstrom,\xe2\x80\x9d Camp Overlook serves as the base of operations for the Red Swallows\xe2\x94\x80a privateer levy tasked with the surveillance of kobold activity in outer La Noscea and along the slopes of Mt. O'Ghomoro. 	4877106	350	81522	81022	81451	500	759	22	0
2162722	U'Ghamaro Mines	"Reeks of sulfur and slumgullion, for sure, but lookin' down from that furnace, I could swear there was somethin' almost beautiful about the place. Either that or the fumes have gotten to me head..." Such were the soldier's words, and I would see as he saw.	The brilliant rainbow-colored hues that permeate the otherwise bistre slopes of O'Ghomoro are a result of the endless flow of toxic slumgullion streaming forth from the labyrinthine warrens that make up U'Ghamaro Mines. As more kobolds arrive on the surface each day, there is a scramble to construct new forges to accommodate them.	4877107	350	81523	81023	81451	1200	1659	22	0
2162723	The Hermit's Hovel	"Someone actually lives there? I'll believe it when I meet the man. Still, you'll not find me complaining\xe2\x94\x80it's a fine place to sit down and rest your weary legs for a spell." Such were the adventurer's words, and I would see as he saw.	While few have ever seen the lord of this humble hideaway which rests precariously on the edge of an unscalable precipice\xe2\x94\x80let alone obtained his permission for entering the premises\xe2\x94\x80that has not stopped travelers from taking full advantage of the respite the location offers, whether it be a dip in the steaming pools, or a few bells' slumber on the soft goosefeather bed.	4877108	350	81524	81024	81451	1800	459	52	0
2162724	The Carline Canopy	Overheard about town: "There's nothing quite like standing beside the mighty waterwheel, watching brave men and women as they come and go."	Nestled cozily within the inn known as the Roost lies the relaxing Carline Canopy, a haven for those seeking a respite from travel's travails or questing's quandaries. Figaga's Gift, the towering waterwheel found outside the caf\xc3\xa9, powers the saws and lathes of the Carpenters' Guild, and is widely considered Gridania's grandest architectural achievement.	4877111	51	81551	81051	81452	800	1159	22	0
2162725	The Lancers' Guild	"In my early days of training, I was told to study the movements of my seniors. Climbing to what I thought the perfect vantage point, I earned no praise, only thorough scolding from my instructor." Such were the guardsman's words, and I would see as he saw.	Founded by legendary Wood Wailer captain Mistalle, the Lancers' Guild doubles as a headquarters for those who keep the peace within Gridania, and the greater peace without. It is to these \xe2\x80\x9cWailing Barracks\xe2\x80\x9d that people come with matters whose resolution requires a polearm's edge, and justice meted out to those who have wronged the forest or forestborn.	4868037	51	81554	81054	81452	500	759	22	0
2162726	The Bannock	"My subordinates have a knack for disappearing from time to time, but not to worry. Climb high and survey the stump below, and the shirkers in the shadows are soon revealed." Such were the guard captain's words, and I would see as he saw.	Built around the stump of a fallen heavenspillar, the Bannock serves as training grounds for Order of the Twin Adder initiates. There are several theories regarding the origin of the area's name, some claiming it is taken from the hard tack issued to Grand Company recruits, others that it is derived from the training stump's resemblance to those selfsame rations.	4877112	54	81556	81056	81452	500	759	22	0
2162727	Haukke Manor	"I fled as fast as my legs could carry me, till I stood atop massive tree roots with nowhere to run. The glow from the windows, so beautiful, yet so terrible..." Such were the madman's words, and I would see as he saw.	Long frowned upon by the people of Gridania as a symbol of excess, the Seedseers would finally submit to pressure from the citizenry, selling the deed to the manor to Lady Amandine of House Dartancours. The word \xe2\x80\x9cHaukke\xe2\x80\x9d is of ancient Padjali origin and means, \xe2\x80\x9cto speak without words.\xe2\x80\x9d	4877113	54	81557	81057	81452	1800	459	22	0
2162728	The Guardian Tree	"When I feel I have lost my way, I look down upon the ancient arbor under the shining sun. I look down, and I listen." Such were the conjurer's words, and I would see as she saw.	Having seen over a thousand summers, the Guardian Tree is purportedly the oldest arbor in all the Black Shroud, and home to the great one\xe2\x94\x80an elder elemental who watches and presides over the forest's denizens. The fruit borne by the tree resembles a plum and is sought after across the Three Continents for its curative properties.	4877163	54	81558	81058	81452	1200	1659	22	0
2162729	Rainbow Bridge	"Shimmering in the sun and mist, the bridge is a sign that for all the pain we have inflicted on our forest home, the elementals still grace us with their favor." Such were the conjurer's words, and I would see as he saw.	When struck by the rare sunbeams which happen to penetrate the thick canopy of the Black Shroud, the veil of fine mist created by one of the East Vein's myriad cataracts projects a brilliant rainbow which appears to connect the river's east and west banks. The grotto hidden behind the veil houses one of the forest's most sacred locations\xe2\x94\x80the Lifemend Stump.	4877165	54	81559	81059	81452	1100	1359	22	0
2162730	The Seedbed	"Flora or fauna, one cannot but marvel at the wonder of birth." Such were the scholar's words, and I would see as he saw.	Illuminated in the soft glow of countless moonspores, the Seedbed is an ancient arbor-turned-nursery used by the sylphs to grow and incubate their offspring, also known as podlings.	4878703	55	81562	81062	81452	1800	459	22	0
2162731	Buscarron's Druthers	"What was I doin' up there at dawn in the pourin' rain? Hells if I can remember, but it wasn't a bad view." Such were the drunkard's words, and I would see as he saw.	The Druthers is run by a disenfranchised ex-sentry-turned-tavernkeep and welcomes all manner of folk, from upstanding to unsavory, so long as they follow Buscarron Strongarm's simple rules of etiquette: sit down, forget your worries, and savor your ale.	4878736	56	81563	81063	81452	800	1159	22	0
2162732	South Shroud Landing	Overheard at a tavern: "Bet the people who built that place never thought it would end up used like that."	Constructed by Highwind Skyways to serve as a landing for cargo airships, this location was quickly abandoned when the imperial presence in the area became too large to ignore. Now the site is used as a makeshift market where bandits and poachers peddle their ill-gotten wares far from the eyes of the law.	4878759	56	81564	81064	81452	800	1159	22	0
2162733	Urth's Gift	"Shrouded in mist, bathed in ephemeral light. I felt as if I'd left the forest behind and come to another world..." Such were the conjurer's words, and I would see as he saw.	Ancient writings tell that in exchange for her lifeblood, Lady Urth was able to seal the Dark Divinity Odin in a crystalline prison beneath a bubbling wellspring. To honor her sacrifice, the land upon which she drew her last breath still bears her name.	4878763	56	81565	81065	81452	1200	1659	22	0
2162734	Quarrymill	"As I was cleaning out the chimneys, I could not help but be struck by the view below. My village may be a humble one, but there's nowhere else I'd call home." Such were the hunter's words, and I would see as he saw.	Once a deal had been struck between the Gelmorrans and the elementals allowing their return to the forest surface, the Elezen began unearthing large quantities of boulders to build the foundations of their new city, Gridania. The waterwheels of Quarrymill were raised to power the hammers which rendered the massive stones into workable blocks.	4878764	56	81566	81066	81452	500	759	22	0
2162735	Ixali Logging Grounds	"I stood there atop the butchered arbor, my fist trembling in anger. Those who would harm our forest home must be shown no quarter." Such were the sentry's words, and I would see as he saw.	The Ixal have never taken well their banishment from the Black Shroud, and to this day continue to fell the hoary sentinels growing on the forest's outskirts. Too heavy to drag back to their settlements in Natalan or faraway Xelphatol, the ill-gotten lumber is tied to balloons buoyed with Ixali airstones and flown to the beast tribe's homeland under the cover of night.	4878773	57	81567	81067	81452	1200	1659	22	0
2162736	Fallen Neurolink	"I don't like it, I can tell you that. That crescent...whatever-it-is...protruding into the sky. It doesn't belong there. It doesn't belong nowhere in this world." So were the guard's words, and I would see as he saw.	Coined by the learned men of Garlond Ironworks, these massive rings were used to dampen spiritual energies, preventing the focusing of power required to wield magicks. No less than five, each measuring hundreds of yalms across, were required to keep Bahamut silent for two full eras...but even then they proved insufficient.	4878784	57	81568	81068	81452	1800	459	22	0
2162737	Alder Springs	"So there I was, starin' out over those naked tree limbs. Was feelin' brave, so I thought I'd see just how far I could go. As it turns out? Pretty far." Such were the mountaineer's words, and I would see as he saw.	Once a vast grove of giant alders, the flames of the Calamity reduced the area to a charred graveyard, leaving nothing of the ancient holt but its name.	4878790	57	81569	81069	81452	800	1159	22	0
2162738	Castrum Marinum	"Say what you will about our foe, you can't deny that the architecture of their outposts has a certain ghastly charm. I would have enjoyed the sunset a while longer, but the cohort doesn't take kindly to tourists." Such were the scout's words, and I would see as he saw.	Situated atop the roiling Rhotano Sea between Aldenard and the eastern coast of Vylbrand, Castrum Marinum serves as the southernmost outpost for the Garlean Empire's XIVth Legion. The cohort stationed on this man-made floating island is primarily tasked with the resupplying of imperial army cohorts deployed in the La Noscea and Thanalan theaters. 	4879319	42	81604	81104	81453	1700	1759	22	0
2162739	Vesper Bay	Overheard in a tavern: "Go where the wealthy go and do what they do, and sooner or later their good fortune will rub off on you. That said, the merchant wasn't too happy when I climbed atop his estate for a better view..."	A bustling port city strategically situated on the western coast of Thanalan and maintained using funds generously provided by Syndicate chairman Lolorito, Vesper Bay serves as a gateway in and out of sultanate-controlled lands. The colossal bronze statue in the main plaza is said to be an exact likeness of said chairman (when viewed from afar).	4879321	42	81605	81105	81453	1200	1659	27	0
2162740	Black Brush Station	"A modern marvel she may be, but a right bitch to keep runnin'. I couldn't tell you how many hours I've spent surveyin' from all directions and altitudes. You can have the view, just give me a good night's sleep!" Such were the railroad man's words, and I would see as he saw.	A marvel of modern innovation, the steam engine has transformed the mining industry, increasing efficiency and profits thrice over. It has also led to the transformation of what was once a thinly manned aetheryte outpost into a thriving crossroads of labor and commerce\xe2\x94\x80a new pillar to support the thriving Ul'dahn economy.	4879611	43	81607	81107	81453	1800	459	22	0
2162741	Gate of Nald	Overheard on the streets: "Lost me job, me family\xe2\x94\x80and any coin I could spend to drown me sorrows. And so I stood atop the canvas, looking out over the wasteland of me life."	One of three main portals accessible by the general populace, the Gate of Nald is wide enough for two fully burdened chocobo carriages to enter abreast and still leave room for the flanking gateguards. Her Royal Majesty Nanamo Ul Namo has commanded that the portcullis remain open night and day, so as to welcome all who would partake of Ul'dah's wonders.	4879612	43	81608	81108	81453	1200	1659	50	0
2162742	The Burning Wall	Overheard in an alehouse: "Standing atop the crystal affords you the best view of the place, if you're brave enough to make the climb..."	Once an unscalable precipice severing eastern Thanalan from the Grand Wake, the Burning Wall earned its name for the deep-red glow it would emit each evening as the sun set. Toppled by the Calamity, that cliff no longer exists\xe2\x94\x80in its place a queer forest of crystalline sentinels and malformed creatures shunned by nature itself.	4879625	44	81612	81112	81453	1200	1659	22	0
2162743	The Golden Bazaar	"A ghost town? Hah! Mark my words, I'll make my fortune there. When the sun is high, I climb atop the fencing and survey the land for untapped veins of ore." Such were the miner's words, and I would see as he saw.	Once a waypoint for traders making the journey between Gridania and Ul'dah, the rise of settlements such as Camp Drybone and Highbridge have all but rendered the once prospering hamlet a ghost town. Rumors of mythril deposits in the nearby mountains and treasure in the ruins of the Invisible City, however, may work to rekindle this dying ember.	4879626	44	81613	81113	81453	800	1159	22	0
2162744	Thal's Respite	"Those who do not pay proper obeisance will find their fortunes all too fleeting. Those who do will feel the tears of mercy washing over them like the pouring rains." Such were the initiate's words, and I would see as he saw.	Overseer of wealth in the afterlife, proper obeisance to the Trader, Thal, is required for those who wish to take belongings accumulated in this world to the hereafter. Thal's Respite is oft used by stout devotees of the Order of Nald'thal as a place of fasting and prayer, but its distance from Ul'dah prevents all but the most affluent from making the journey.	4879627	44	81614	81114	81453	1800	459	58	0
2162745	Nald's Reflection	"Those who do not pay proper obeisance will find fortune ever elusive. Those who do will see the fog lifted, and know the joys of abundance." Such were the initiate's words, and I would see as he saw.	Overseer of wealth and commerce upon the corporeal plane, it is believed that through fervent worship of the Trader Nald, one will reap immeasurable fortune in one's living years. Prince and pauper alike once made pilgrimages to this remote place of prayer in search of prosperity...until, that is, the Milvaneth Sacrarium opened a new (toll-based) temple within Ul'dah.	4879628	45	81615	81115	81453	500	759	58	0
2162746	Zahar'ak	"Some call the sight bleak, but to me it's a thing of beauty. The winds pound away at the hills, but strong we stand\xe2\x94\x80our gaze locked on our foe." Such were the sentry's words, and I would see what he saw.	Loosely translated as \xe2\x80\x9cland of perseverance,\xe2\x80\x9d Zahar'ak is a forward stronghold for the Amalj'aa host based in Zanr'ak. The beast tribe believes the scorched plains of Thanalan to be hallowed ground blessed by the cleansing flames of their primal deity, Ifrit, and as such are intent on driving from the land all whom they deem invaders.	4879629	45	81616	81116	81453	500	759	22	0
2162747	The Sagolii Desert	"After a fortnight of wandering, I found myself under the searing sun, looking out upon the ruins of Allag. It was then I swore to myself: I will not succumb\xe2\x94\x80not this day." Such were the wayfarer's words, and I would see what he saw.	According to the Sons of Saint Coinach, the Sagolii Desert was once a verdant sea of lush plains capable of sustaining great civilizations, as is evidenced by the ruins recently discovered in the area. How such a place devolved into a lifeless desert remains a mystery, but recent disaster tells us an ancient calamity is the likely culprit.	4879630	45	81617	81117	81453	1200	1659	22	0
2162748	The Sunken Temple of Qarn	Overheard in a tavern: "...Ah, a fellow antiquarian! There's a slanted stone slab that affords you the best vantage point of the ruins."	Most scholars of ancient Belah'dian civilization claim this twisting labyrinth of complex chambers to be a place of worship dedicated to the sun goddess, Azeyma. Recent diggings, however, have uncovered older chambers buried beneath the new containing relics not of the Sixth Astral Era, suggesting that the temple may have been built by a different people.	4879631	45	81618	81118	81453	1200	1659	22	0
2162749	Minotaur Malm	"Beads of sweat flying from their broad shoulders, massive muscles tightening and loosening\xe2\x94\x80no, I've not seen a finer sight in all the realm." Such were the warrioress's words, and I would see what she saw.	Local legend has that long ago, a young goatherd leading his pack to water at Forgotten Springs was set upon and chased a full malm through these caves by a minotaur. There has yet to be a second sighting of the creature, but the stories are enough to frighten away most who would consider passage through this trading post used by the Seventy-Seven Caravans.	4879632	45	81619	81119	81453	500	759	30	0
2162750	East Watchtower	"On the watch, slumber's siren call is your greatest foe. When I feel myself drifting off at my post, I envision my commander standing before me, and put the fear of the gods in myself." Such were the sentry's words, and I would see what he saw.	To power their legions of warmachina, the Garleans require a steady supply of the aether-based fuel known as ceruleum. Bluefog housing the largest deposit in Eorzea, the Empire has begun their own mining operation but a stone's throw from the allied refineries, heightening tensions in the area and prompting the construction of two watchtowers.	4879633	46	81620	81120	81453	500	759	31	0
2162751	Ceruleum Pipeline	"My duties include keeping the portcullis well oiled. A right fine view on a clear day, but don't lose your balance\xe2\x94\x80it's a long way down." Such were the soldier's words, and I would see what he saw.	Even before airships and engines were commonplace in Eorzea, Amajina & Sons Mineral Concern recognized the potential value of ceruleum and laid claim to nearly all of the untapped deposits in northern Thanalan. In an ironic twist, for many years before the Garlean invasion, the Concern's biggest customer was, in fact, the imperial army.	4879634	46	81621	81121	81453	1800	459	22	0
2162752	Bluefog	"Fog ain't supposed to be blue, least not where I come from\xe2\x94\x80gives me the creeps. On such rare occasions as it clears up, I look upon the valley from on high. Simple pleasure, but it keeps me from losin' my bloody mind." Such were the laborer's words, and I would see what he saw.	Though abundant on the northern continent of Ilsabard, only a handful of ceruleum deposits have ever been discovered on Aldenard, the largest being buried under the Sea of Spires in northern Thanalan. Ceruleum is a highly unstable substance and will begin to evaporate when in contact with air, resulting in the bluish haze from which this area earns its name.	4879635	46	81622	81122	81453	1200	1659	22	0
2162753	Raubahn's Push	"Even in the wind and swirling snow, the talons are unmistakable, clutching toward the skies. Don't ask what compelled me to climb to the very tip of one, but I can tell you the sight was something to behold." Such were the sentry's words, and I would see what he saw.	In the final days of the Sixth Astral Era, the ceruleum fields of northern Thanalan proved to be one of the most hotly contested areas in all Eorzea, with the Empire amassing a giant host outside of Bluefog to seize control of the local fuel refineries. Though outnumbered three to one, Raubahn and his army succeeded in \xe2\x80\x9cpushing\xe2\x80\x9d back the enemy.	4879636	46	81623	81123	81453	800	1159	22	0
2162754	Abandoned Amajina Mythril Mine	"I didn't know what those madmen were going to do with me, and I wasn't about to find out. When the fog descended, I snuck out across a collapsed pillar. Lucky to be alive, though I do wish I'd had the luxury to enjoy the view." Such were the adventurer's words, and I would see what he saw.	The discovery of mythril in a small copper mine in Bluefog triggered the Great Rush which saw would-be prospectors flock to the Sea of Spires in search of quick and easy fortune. The veins that ran through the mountains, however, were not deep, and it was but ten summers before the mines ceased to yield the precious metal, forcing many to abandon their claims. 	4879637	46	81624	81124	81453	1800	459	22	0
2162755	The Nail	"I suppose the view is impressive, yes, but it's rare that I have a moment to appreciate it. Too much work to be done before the sun goes down." Such were the draughtsman's words, and I would see what he saw.	As is described in the \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03Enchiridion\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03, to ensure the realm of man did not drift apart from the firmament, Halone struck the Nail through both, ever binding the two. And though assailed on all sides by great metal shards fallen from the lesser moon Dalamud's crust, the ancient peak remained standing, a testament to the land's life force.	4879638	63	81651	81151	81454	1700	1759	22	0
2162756	The Observatorium	Overheard at a tavern: "It wasn't what you could call me finest hour. I slipped and fell, and snagged me garments on something-or-another. I was enjoying the sight\xe2\x94\x80till I realized how damned ridiculous I'd look if anyone came upon me. Dusted meself off and went on me way."	Three hundred years ago, Ishgardian astrologian Adaunel the Younger convinced the Holy See that he could predict the comings and goings of the Dravanian Horde by studying the movements of the heavens, and thus secured funding for the construction of the First Dicasterial Observatorium of Aetherial and Astrological Phenomena and its grand astroscope.	4879639	63	81652	81152	81454	1800	459	22	0
2162757	The Frozen Fang	"From on high, I looked down upon the dread carcass. Ah, to have been the hero who pierced the wyrm's heart with a ballista that day! The mere thought stirred my blood on the coldest of days." Such were the knight's words, and I would see what he saw.	In years past, the hot alpine summers would have seen this fallen Dravanian outflyer blown with maggots and reduced to bones in a matter of days. Now, in the endless winter wrought by the Calamity, the carcass rests in the permafrost under a thick blanket of snow, perfectly preserved since the day he was pierced through the heart by a ballista.	4879640	63	81653	81153	81454	800	1159	22	0
2162758	The Holy See of Ishgard	"I look upon my homeland, its proud spires soaring in the azure, and swear a silent oath. My spear shall not leave my hand until the last dread wyrm has fallen." Such were the knight's words, and I would see what he saw.	For the past thousand years, Ishgard has waged a bloody war with the dragons of Dravania. To fend off the enemy horde, a complex web of defenses, magical and corporeal, has been added piecemeal to the city proper's outer walls, transforming her into an impenetrable bastion, while at the same time, isolating her and her people from the outside world.	4879641	63	81654	81154	81454	500	759	22	0
2162759	Boulder Downs	"In the shadow of those unholy rocks, the mightiest giant will look as a dwarf. Yet from the right vantage point, even one of humble stature can look upon them all." Such were the knight's words, and I would see as he saw.	Before the Calamity, Boulder Downs was a vast sloped lea littered with moraine deposited by realm-swallowing glaciers long receded. The rain of debris that accompanied the fall of Dalamud, however, transformed the landscape into a frozen wasteland pocked with gaping impact craters and peculiar dark matter formations.	4879642	63	81655	81155	81454	1700	1759	22	0
2162760	The Fury's Gaze	"Dragons, heretics\xe2\x94\x80I've stared into the eye of many a foe. Stone has no eyes, yet no other gaze can pierce me to the very depths of my soul." Such were the knight's words, and I would see as he saw.	A place holy to all Ishgardians, it is believed that when a man stands within this hidden grotto, the Fury Herself will reach deep into the darkest recesses of his soul and lay out his sins before him, allowing the man to repent those failings. The Monument Tower nearby was built to protect this hallowed ground from the taint of dragons and heretics.	4879643	63	81656	81156	81454	1800	459	22	0
2162761	Snowcloak	"As I stood there, my thoughts turned to those left behind in the west. The sun shone strong, yet it could not keep my tears from turning to ice on my cheeks." Such were the researcher's words, and I would see as she saw.	The bitter cold which swept over the Coerthas highlands following the Calamity did not only blanket the region in snow and ice, but transformed the water of Twinpools and the Swiftrun into a mountainous flow of ice\xe2\x94\x80a flow which has slowly crept through the western Coerthas highlands and now has completely engulfed Gargoyle Crossing, preventing passage.	4879644	63	81657	81157	81454	800	1159	22	0
2162762	Camp Dragonhead	"Clearing the parapets after a snowfall is arduous work, but gazing out over the hoar-kissed peaks, a man might forget his aches and pains for a while." So were the knight's words, and I would see as he saw.	Its name taken from a rocky outcropping said to be the head of a Dravanian king turned to stone by the almighty hand of Halone, this outpost acts as the Coerthas central highlands' southernmost line of defense for the Holy See, tasked with fending off Ixali raids from Natalan, skirmishes by heretic factions, and the occasional yeti scare.	4879645	63	81658	81158	81454	1200	1659	22	0
2162763	The Steel Vigil	Overheard in a tavern: "...Bollocks, I say! Ye haven't truly seen the Vigil until ye've seen it from that very spot. Ye'll be wantin' to tread carefully, mind ye."	One of four citadel watchtowers built along the Sea of Clouds, the Steel Vigil warned the Holy See of aerial attacks for centuries before being razed and gutted by the Dravanian Horde and their vile commander, Svara. Now, only the outer walls remain, leaving a bitter reminder of the dragons' destructive power.	4879646	63	81659	81159	81454	500	759	22	0
2162764	Castrum Centri	"It's unnatural, is what it is\xe2\x94\x80roads and towers made of metal\xe2\x94\x80and yet I couldn't avert my eyes. Then I heard the great steel beast rousing in the distance, and thought I'd best be on my way." Such were the scout's words, and I would see as he saw.	Castrum Centri was erected with material salvaged from the ruins of Castrum Novum\xe2\x94\x80the Garlean Empire's first major outpost in Eorzea, constructed in the final year of the Sixth Astral Era by VIIth Legion legatus Nael van Darnus. It houses several ceruleum mining pits, a magitek manufactory, and the Phantom Train, used to transport ordnance to outlying castra.	4879647	67	81701	81201	81455	1200	1659	22	0
2162765	The Crystal Tower	"It was a scene not of this world: a forest of crystal, and in the distance a spire that stretched so high it could have touched the heavens..." Such were the adventurer's words, and I would see as she saw.	As if somehow beckoned forth from its hypogeal prison by the events of the Calamity, this sky-scraping spire now commands the Mor Dhonan horizon. Through their research, the Sons of Saint Coinach have determined that the monolith, also known as Syrcus Tower, was constructed to collect and store the endless energies of the sun.	4879648	67	81702	81202	81455	1800	459	22	0
2162766	Rathefrost	"In fields of crystal, I stood tall atop one of the stones and took in the view in all its shimmering desolation." Such were the adventurer's words, and I would see what he saw.	The fall of the \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03Agrius\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 into Silvertear Falls not only drained the magnificent multi-tiered lake, but instantly crystallized the majority of the region's flora\xe2\x94\x80a result of mass quantities of ceruleum fuel reacting with aether released upon Midgardsormr's death. What remains is a brilliant, yet dead landscape akin to a twisted garden pocked with blooming geodes.	4879649	67	81703	81203	81455	1200	1659	22	0
2162767	The Keeper of the Lake	Overheard in a tavern: "I was an adventurer meself, aye. Till that day when, from atop a tree, I saw that ungodly thing\xe2\x94\x80that twisted mass of metal and scale.
