Even if this orphaned avian were to stumble across his birth parent, chances are he would not even blink an eye, for it is well documented that immediately after hatching, chocobos recognize the first thing they see as their mother\xe2\x94\x80that being\x02\x10\x01\x03you.

It is not fully known why spriggans hoard precious rocks and minerals, though scholars would have us believe that it is the rocks and minerals which are hoarding the spriggans, hence the creatures' scientific classification as\x02\x10\x01\x03soulkin.

32	buffalo calf	buffalo calves	Summon your buffalo calf minion. Milk-fed until tender and juicy. Not that anyone would \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03ever\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 think of eating him.	When the Scions of the Seventh Dawn began clearing out the Waking Sands in preparation for the move to Revenant's Toll, this wide-eyed calf was discovered hiding in a disused linen closet. Though an inquiry was made by the Antecedent\x02\x10\x01\x03herself, it is still not known\x02\x10\x01\x03who was keeping the beast.

33	cactuar cutting	cactuar cuttings	Summon your cactuar cutting minion. Take care not to suffer 1,000 points of damage...to your heart.	Hab, loneliest zombie in the realm, is certain that this cactuar cutting was taken from his trusty companion Sabotendrick. Or if not, then most positively Sabotendred. What he does not know, is that it is, in fact, from the oft forgotten\x02\x10\x01\x03Sabotendale.	The interior of its arm\x02\x10\x01\x03holds a surprising amount\x02\x10\x01\x03of fresh, drinkable water.\x02\x10\x01\x03  - Common Knowledge	0	0	0	1	0	0			451	0	4529	27	100	0	100	20	0	0	20	2	0	3	27	0	10	100	100	3	0	20	99	0
34	smallshell	smallshells	Summon your smallshell minion. The mere sight of this wee wavekin may cause severe psychological trauma to those who spent years of their lives on faraway shores culling his relatives.	As is implied by its name, the smallshell's shell is small. What is not widely known is that unlike normal crabs whose shells grow thicker and, hence, larger as the crabs age, smallshell carapaces actually reduce in size due to erosion over the\x02\x10\x01\x03wavekin's lifespan, until\x02\x10\x01\x03nothing is left but legs.

35	wolf pup	wolf pups	Summon your wolf pup minion. Idolizes one Gaius van Baelsar for obvious reasons.	Bred to serve as a war wolf in the Imperial Garlean Army, this pup was rescued before any permanent damage could be done to its playful spirit. He will follow you to the end of the world and back...as\x02\x10\x01\x03long as you toss him an\x02\x10\x01\x03occasional biscuit.

36	beady eye	beady eyes	Summon your beady eye minion. That feeling you get sometimes that you are being watched? More often than not it is him.	One of the most outlandish theories recently posed by scholars of the void is that ahrimans do not reproduce by typical sexual means, but rather by shedding tears which eventually grow into new creatures.	Black scorpion to sharpen\x02\x10\x01\x03one's wit; ahriman\x02\x10\x01\x03membrane for the mind.\x02\x10\x01\x03  - Severian	0	0	0	1	0	0			454	0	4531	30	100	0	100	30	0	0	0	2	0	8	30	0	10	100	100	3	0	20	109	0
37	fledgling dodo	fledgling dodos	Summon your fledgling dodo minion. Properly trained not to eructate, regurgitate, expectorate, or flatulate.	Dodos mature extremely fast, going from fledgling to full-grown fryer in but a few short moons. This, coupled with the fact an adult female can lay up to seven eggs a sennight, makes this particular cloudkin the perfect option for\x02\x10\x01\x03feeding the hungry masses.\x02\x10\x01\x03	Lightning Drools over the\x02\x10\x01\x03Bismarck's Delightful\x02\x10\x01\x03Grilled Dodo!\x02\x10\x01\x03  - The Harbor Herald	0	0	0	1	0	0			455	0	4532	31	100	0	100	30	0	0	30	2	0	8	31	0	10	100	100	3	0	20	105	0
38	coblyn larva	coblyn larvae	Summon your coblyn larva minion. Too dangerous to allow to grow any larger...too adorable to condemn to the furnace.	Coblyns will lay their eggs near ore deposits so that when the larvae emerge, they will have a ready supply of nourishment to form their protective outer carapaces. This is a slow process which involves dousing the ore in digestive\x02\x10\x01\x03fluid, waiting for it to clarify,\x02\x10\x01\x03then ingesting the ooze.	The lads go through gear\x02\x10\x01\x03faster'n a coblyn chewin'\x02\x10\x01\x03on a chunk of mythril.\x02\x10\x01\x03  - Wawarukka	0	0	0	1	0	0			456	0	4533	32	100	0	100	30	0	0	0	2	0	8	32	0	10	100	100	3	0	20	97	0
39	wind-up aldgoat	wind-up aldgoats	Summon your wind-up aldgoat. No aldgoats were harmed in the making of this automaton.	While in Ishgardian folklore the aldgoat is used to represent greed and gluttony, the Dunesfolk believe the insatiable creatures are a symbol of wealth and prosperity, and will present aldgoat fetishes to families with newborn\x02\x10\x01\x03children.	A nice big aldgoat steak\x02\x10\x01\x03should put some color\x02\x10\x01\x03back in 'er cheeks.\x02\x10\x01\x03  - Lyngsath	0	0	0	1	0	0			457	0	4534	205	100	0	85	30	0	0	0	1	0	8	0	0	10	100	100	3	0	20	96	0

While the hatchlings of other flightless cloudkin have been observed covered in a dull brown coat of down when they emerge from their eggs, apkallus enter the world covered in the same vivid green plumage they will bear for their entire\x02\x10\x01\x03lives.

41	goobbue sproutling	goobbue sproutlings	Summon your goobbue sproutling minion. Has been known to attack kittens for no apparent reason.	To achieve their cyclopean size, goobbues must maintain a daily diet of several times their own weight. Luckily, the seedkin are not finicky eaters, and will consume almost anything that cannot outrun them. If rumors are to be\x02\x10\x01\x03believed, this includes\x02\x10\x01\x03Lalafells.

42	bite-sized pudding	bite-sized puddings	Summon your bite-sized pudding minion. Not intended for consumption.	Unable to reproduce, puddings increase their number solely via mitosis. Because of this, it is widely believed that all Eorzea's puddings descended from a single entity\xe2\x94\x80a proto-pudding, if you will. This, however, leaves us with the question:\x02\x10\x01\x03whence did the first\x02\x10\x01\x03pudding come?

Part of the Guildmaster Series, this high-quality replica is so exact in its rendition of the vanguard's build that Garlemald has banned the item's import into the empire's outlying provinces, for fear the data gleaned from it will be used by rebel\x02\x10\x01\x03forces still active in these\x02\x10\x01\x03lands.

Snatched from its hill while still young by infamous naturalist Marcette Manne, this poor creature has suffered countless experiments filled with endless pokings, proddings, potations, and panaceas. Compared to that, following\x02\x10\x01\x03an adventurer around all\x02\x10\x01\x03day is a veritable vacation.	Hear me, you mole\x02\x10\x01\x03bastards?

One must take care when harvesting mandragoras, for if the roots are disturbed they will emit a high-pitched scream powerful enough to shatter glass over a malm away.	While little is known about\x02\x10\x01\x03them, what is known\x02\x10\x01\x03tends to be disturbing.\x02\x10\x01\x03  - Eorzean Naturalist	0	0	0	1	0	0			466	0	4542	42	100	0	90	20	0	30	0	2	0	8	42	0	10	100	100	3	0	20	107	0

Unlike most species in which the female bears the offspring, only sylph males are capable of reproduction, and they do so via the single flower found upon their heads. After the flower is fertilized, it will eventually fall off,\x02\x10\x01\x03giving rise to a child\x02\x10\x01\x03known as a podling.

Despite it being the first, and most ambitious undertaking by Highwind Skyways founder Tatanora, the \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03Invincible\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 actually never took flight\xe2\x94\x80its ten-year construction period plagued by accidents, material shortages, sabotage, and\x02\x10\x01\x03outright incompetence.

Once upon a time, there was not a man, woman, or child in all of Limsa Lominsa who did not know the name Zazaroon, mummer extraordinaire. However, a taste for spiced rum, a failed marriage, and several run-ins with the Barracudas\x02\x10\x01\x03saw the Qiqirn fall from\x02\x10\x01\x03the limelight into oblivion.

This poor chocobo chick was as yellow as an ear of millioncorn before one day being doused in black ink by a random passerby bedecked in silver accessories.

Similar to voidsent dullahan, mindflayers also lack a corporeal form and must possess a host to be able to exert force on our realm. Whereas the dullahan, however, are limited to the possession of inorganic objects such as steel,\x02\x10\x01\x03mindflayers tend to prefer\x02\x10\x01\x03the dead as their vessels.

It is apparently a rogue,\x02\x10\x01\x03outcast from its kin, a\x02\x10\x01\x03stranger in a strange land.\x02\x10\x01\x03  - Tomaj	0	0	0	1	0	1			745	0	4580	42	100	0	100	30	0	0	0	2	0	8	42	0	10	100	100	3	0	20	107	0

Destined to a life with a man she did not love, nary a night passed when the Mandragora Queen did not dream of throwing herself into the sea's eternal embrace...until, that is, she laid eyes on the noble Eggplant Knight.

Nearly half of the coin provided to the Goldsmiths' Guild for the crafting of this wind-up doll bearing the likeness of Scion of the Seventh Dawn Y'shtola was paid to Atelier Fen-Yll for hand-sewn leather boots matching those worn by\x02\x10\x01\x03the enigmatic Archon.

An accurate representation of the soldiers who once made up the greater portion of the Allagan Imperial Army.	If Sons of Saint Coinach anthropogeographer Rammbroes is to be believed, towards the end of their civilization, the Allagans began using automatons such as this to fight their wars (which had been deemed inhumane, yet\x02\x10\x01\x03ultimately necessary to\x02\x10\x01\x03spread imperial peace).

93	treasure box	treasure boxes	Summon your treasure box minion. It is unknown what manner of spirit possesses this tiny treasure chest, but the fact that it will not hesitate to nip at the fingers of any who try and pry it open is painfully evident.	Originally used by an Eorzean Alliance paymaster to store Allied Seals...until the box began eating them. She sold the box in hopes of recouping some of her losses (skimming off adventurer rewards to cover the rest...until she was\x02\x10\x01\x03caught and sentenced\x02\x10\x01\x03to a public flogging).

Before it was realized that the tapirs were, in fact, consuming the dreams of their owners, several hundred were sold to Ul'dahn nobles seeking a better night's sleep. Surprisingly, there were few complaints\x02\x10\x01\x03from buyers, even after\x02\x10\x01\x03learning the truth.

The Nana bear's origins can be traced back to Ul'dahn princess Nanakko who, on her eighth nameday, asked her father for a bear. Despite a realm-wide search, no bears were found, and so the Goldsmiths' Guild was commissioned to craft\x02\x10\x01\x03one from a drawing found\x02\x10\x01\x03in an ancient bestiary.	There isn't enough honey\x02\x10\x01\x03in all the Yard to satisfy\x02\x10\x01\x03that sweet-toothed sellary.\x02\x10\x01\x03  - Honey Yard Hivekeep	0	0	0	1	0	0			752	0	4585	239	100	0	100	20	0	0	0	1	0	8	0	0	10	100	100	3	0	20	96	0

Despite adamant claims by Amajina & Sons Mineral Concern that their donation of over five score carts to the orphans of Stonesthrow was a simple act of charity, opponents of the guild insist it was a scheme to recruit inexpensive\x02\x10\x01\x03child labor for Thanalan's\x02\x10\x01\x03myriad mines.

Inspired by the words of Millith Ironheart, this daring squirrel longs to travel the realm in search of the legendary golden acorn, and hopes that trailing in your shadow will ensure that he isn't eaten before he discovers the mother lode.

This clockwork automaton has been crafted at the behest of the Adventurers' Guild in celebration of the Rising, Eorzea's annual celebration of rebirth. Reports of crazed Thancred fans stalking the summoned servitors are more\x02\x10\x01\x03common than one\x02\x10\x01\x03might believe.

This miracle of modern mechanics is actually a miracle of ancient Allagan mechanics reverse engineered and then modified with advanced Garlean magitek technology.

101	puff of darkness	puffs of darkness	Summon your puff of darkness minion. When standing nearby, prithee refrain from coughing, sneezing, waving, flailing, or performing any other means of wild gesticulation, lest the puff be lost for eternity.	When this automaton resembling one crafted by a goldsmith hanged for dabbling in the dark arts was discovered, it prompted authorities to exhume the recently buried body.

102	naughty nanka	naughty nankas	Summon your naughty nanka minion. Like its parent, the ninki nanka, this slippery wavekin will breed like a rabbit if left unsupervised.	Instead of laying her eggs in a pond or river where they might be devoured by predators, the ninki nanka female deposits her offspring upon the back of the father, who then carries and protects the brood until it is ready to face the world\x02\x10\x01\x03on its own.

105	Hoary the Snowman	Hoary the Snowmen	Summon your Hoary the Snowman minion. Hoary the Snowman was a jolly happy soul, without a pipe, and without a nose, and two eyes made out of something other than coal. Probably slag.	While no one knows the exact origins of Hoary the Snowman and the legends surrounding this animated mass of ice and snow, the gifting of dolls created in his likeness to good girls and boys is not uncommon during the Starlight\x02\x10\x01\x03Celebration.

It would be foolish to believe that a chocobo could achieve this size dining on greens alone, regardless of how many hundreds of bushels were devoured...in a single sitting. Chicken bones found beneath the chick's bedding suggest\x02\x10\x01\x03he may have a taste\x02\x10\x01\x03for his succulent cousins.	I cannot deny what you say is\x02\x10\x01\x03true any more than I can deny\x02\x10\x01\x03a chocobo's arse is yellow.\x02\x10\x01\x03  - Path Companion	0	0	0	1	0	0			800	0	4606	1	100	0	100	1	0	0	0	1	0	8	0	0	10	100	100	3	0	20	104	0
107	wind-up Yda	wind-up Ydas	Summon your wind-up Yda minion. Comes complete with irremovable mask.	Due to her apparent lack of wit and tendency to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, people are quick to forget that Yda is not only a Scion of the Seventh Dawn, but also an Archon of the Circle of Knowing, handpicked by the\x02\x10\x01\x03legendary Louisoix\x02\x10\x01\x03to serve Eorzea.

After a clerical error resulted in a sizable windfall for the organization, Scions of the Seventh Dawn coinkeeper Tataru took it upon herself to use the funds to commission wind-up automatons crafted in the likeness of her\x02\x10\x01\x03own favorite members\xe2\x94\x80\x02\x10\x01\x03Papalymo being the first.

109	wind-up Urianger	wind-up Uriangers	Summon your wind-up Urianger minion. When the septenary moon did wane, there sounded a garrulous and convoluted monologue. A new minion had roused, one whose identity lieth within our ken.	After commissioning several other wind-up Archons, the Scions of the Seventh Dawn coinkeeper realized that she had almost enough gil to order a seventh...almost. And so the robed and hooded Urianger was crafted without hair or other\x02\x10\x01\x03anatomical features to\x02\x10\x01\x03keep the cost down.	Frustratingly, Urianger's\x02\x10\x01\x03words leave rather a lot\x02\x10\x01\x03to interpretation.\x02\x10\x01\x03   - Papalymo	0	0	0	1	0	0			880	0	4603	262	100	0	100	10	0	0	0	1	0	8	0	0	10	100	100	3	0	20	96	0
110	fat cat	fat catz	Summon your fat cat minion. Despite convincing research by top academics from around the realm and beyond, most Miqo'te scholars refuse to believe that there may be some ancestral connection between their race and cats (fat or not).	Born in an unmarked alley in an unnamed town, this poor creature had to hunt the mean streets just to stay alive...until learning that following retainers and feeding off the slaughter left in their wakes was a safer, easier way to\x02\x10\x01\x03a full belly.

When discovered by your retainer on a foray deep into the highlands of Coerthas, this miniature monstrosity was both cold and hungry (though the former condition most likely did not affect him much), and a bowl of hot broth was\x02\x10\x01\x03all it took to lure him\x02\x10\x01\x03from the forest back home.

112	mummy's little mummy	mummy's little mummies	Summon your mummy's little mummy minion. While as cute as a button, remember, mummies are ultimately embalmed corpses damned to eternal thralldom in the land of the living. Have fun.	It is believed that the ancient technique of mummification\xe2\x94\x80which involved embalming, organ removal, wrapping, and the burial in a multilayered sarcophagus\xe2\x94\x80was an expensive undertaking. That it was performed on a\x02\x10\x01\x03child can attest to\x02\x10\x01\x03his parents' devotion.

The original \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03Enterprise\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 was designed and built while Garlond family prodigy Cid was still working as a military engineer for the Garlean Empire.

The never-ending flow of adventurers into Eorzea has placed quite a burden on the realm's little letter carriers.

After several turns of the sun sloshing about in the depths of a ninja betta's belly, this freshly hatched fry has given up swimming altogether and taken to the skies.

Lacking the spells required to animate a gift in the same manner in which the ancients animated bricks, the crafter of this quaint creation simply cut a pair of holes into a wooden box and slipped it on a spriggan.\x02\x10\x01\x03Problem solved.

Without the means to make a fire, he attempted to eat the fowl raw, only to find himself the victim of a furious counterattack. Impressed by the bird's\x02\x10\x01\x03tenacity, he promptly\x02\x10\x01\x03made him his pet.

It is said Ixali engineer Dezul Qualan began crafting war dirigibles after having a vision of ninety-nine red balloons floating over the Black Shroud.	The last time Ixali engineer Dezul Qualan was seen was the day he boarded his greatest creation\xe2\x94\x80a war balloon thrice the size of any ever built, and equipped with enough provisions to last a man a full moon in the clouds.

Unsatisfied with the explosive power of his first creation, 789th Order Acolyte Ba Go returned to his laboratories deep within the faction dig to create the \xe2\x80\x9ckobolder\xe2\x80\x9d (a name he was quite pleased with), only to see it sold for scrap\x02\x10\x01\x03by his dim-witted brethren.

Spiteful claims that this adorable black chocobo hatchling is, in fact, simply another plain yellow chocobo colored with pine tar in a feeble attempt to prey on prospective buyers have only fueled the natural-born flyer's\x02\x10\x01\x03passion to take to\x02\x10\x01\x03the skies.

The tale of Kain\xe2\x94\x80the dragoon who abandoned his duty for honor\xe2\x94\x80is well known amongst Ishgardian children. To maximize the height on his jumps, the craftsman of this clockwork automaton lined the main control springs with\x02\x10\x01\x03over-aspected wind\x02\x10\x01\x03crystals.	It's all right.

Perfect for international summits, family get-togethers, pre- or post-battle gatherings, or any other occasion where the recapitulation of past occurrences is absolutely, positively necessary.	In an attempt to secure funding for the financially strapped organization, the Crystal Braves treasurer took it upon himself to have three score thousand crafted and delivered to Rowena's House of Splendors for sale...\x02\x10\x01\x03where they have been\x02\x10\x01\x03collecting dust since...

In an attempt to cover the financial losses suffered when creating three score thousand wind-up Alphinauds, the Crystal Braves treasurer took it upon himself to simply swap the mammet's hair\x02\x10\x01\x03bows and rebrand the\x02\x10\x01\x03dolls as wind-up Alisaies.

A routine inspection of Scion spending ledgers uncovered an order placed for ten score automata crafted in Tataru's image.

Indeed, sales have been impressive, the item bringing in just\x02\x10\x01\x03enough gil to pay for\x02\x10\x01\x03the founder's debts.	Run, Cid. Or stay.\x02\x10\x01\x03It makes no matter.

Symbols of purity and innocence, newborn unicorns are kept by the Ishgardian church to create holy water used in sacred rites\xe2\x94\x80a process that involves the creatures dipping their horns in spring water while a sanctified priest\x02\x10\x01\x03blesses it.

While the means by which this otherworldly devourer of aether became trapped in a treasure coffer is most certainly a mystery worthy of further investigation, the real question on everyone's minds here is, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you let it out?\xe2\x80\x9d	Let all know that\x02\x10\x01\x03a new threat to the\x02\x10\x01\x03peace has emerged.\x02\x10\x01\x03   - Sixth Astral Era Crier	0	0	1	1	0	0			894	0	4629	72	100	0	100	10	0	0	0	2	0	8	69	0	10	100	100	3	0	20	97	0

After suffering countless barbs from his bullying brothers, this tiny cloudkin had enough and left its home in Neverreap to find someplace he'd be called beautiful, too.

Though its wings appear to be constructs of some sort rather than actual body parts, any who draw close are met with a violent flurry of scratching and punching, making it impossible to thoroughly inspect the creature's backside.

There are several theories as to how a beastkin native to the mist-covered peaks of southeastern Ilsabard ended up thousands of leagues away from its home...and most involve an unhealthy infatuation with the furry creature by\x02\x10\x01\x03a certain Imperial Legatus.

One night, after ripping the heart from a griffin's breast and holding it aloft for gods and men to behold, a Clan Centurio hunter turned to see a tiny wide-eyed cub shivering in a now-motherless nest.

Despite being found lapping up day-old vomit behind the Forgotten Knight, the air of nobility displayed by this pup as he rolled in the filth was proof enough of his royal bloodline, and before the night was through, an offical pedigree was\x02\x10\x01\x03drawn up, changing\x02\x10\x01\x03Gestahl's life forever.
