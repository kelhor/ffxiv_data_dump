The Brugaire Consortium is known for the expediency with which it fills its orders. If you refuse to complete the items I have requested, I will simply hire another adventurer to do my bidding.

You seem competent enough in your chosen trade. Would you consider contributing a few more whacks of the proverbial hammer in service of Brugaire?	I see. Off with you then.

Everything seems to be in order; a fine job, if I do say so myself. You ever think about hanging up your adventurer's britches, let me know. There might be a place for you on the \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03Princess\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03.	The Navigator did well to guide you here, but don't think she'll save you if my order isn't ready soon.	But before you trade in your land legs, could a lady ask one last favor? Those items I requested...might you be able to craft a few more? There's coin to be had, don't you worry.	That's unfortunate. My crew and I set sail soon, and I've never been one for waiting. Perhaps next time, then.	Such fine work! You are either a master at your craft, or a master at finding someone who's a master at their craft to make you look like a master at your craft. Either way, the Princess gets her supplies, and you get your reward. Everyone wins!

Hand it over, then! Pleasure doing business and all that!	Are you getting to it, or do I have to get on you!?	Oh, wait. Where are you going? I wasn't finished. Would a \x02\x08\x0f\xe9\x05\xff\x06woman\xff\x04man\x03 of your means be interested in whipping up a few more of those fine items? The master likes to see that he's always prepared.

Working as a sutler for the Ishgardians can be both a curse and a blessing. While the seemingly endless conflict with the dragons makes for good business, the extreme location of this conflict makes it difficult to maintain my stock. You adventurers are a Twelvesend!	I believe someone once said good things come to those who wait. Obviously that person did not have orders to fill.	You adventurers are a Twelvesend! But do you know what I appreciate most of your lot? That you are always willing to do more work, should there be extra coin in it for you. Oh, and look here. I have extra coin! Might you be willing to procure more items?	Did I mention I had coin? Well, no matter, then. I have what I need for the time being. If I require more, I suppose I can simply find myself another adventurer.	Yes, yes. This is exactly what I needed. Perhaps with the profits made from this surplus I can finally purchase that snow wolf jacket I've had my eye on. Any extra layer is welcome in this cold.

One can never tell when the dragon horde will strike next, and I would like to have my stock secure when it does.	The craftsmanship is excellent. The knights I serve will be beyond pleased... Now, whether they can live long enough to appreciate it, is another matter. But such are the ways of war.	The very lives of the men and women of this place ride on whether or not I can provide them with quality materiel in a timely manner. If you are incapable of fulfilling my request, then might I suggest finding someone who can?	The most ill-stricken of the knights may not be fortunate enough to find me before my stock is depleted once more. You see, no matter how much I procure, the demand is always greater than the supply. Now, if there were some way to increase my stock...	Oh, I understand. There is more to life as an adventurer than seeing knights are properly equipped so that they might return to their families alive, rather than in several pieces.	Thank you for the extra effort, \x02\x08\x18\xe9\x05\xff\x0agood lady\xff\x09good sir\x03. Knowing that the work we do might save even a single life... It makes this all worthwhile.

I must write that down somewhere. Ah, but to business. Did you have any trouble finding us out here? Are the items I requested in that nebulous bag of yours? Are you going to stop me? Because if you do not, I may keep talking until one of us collapses.	I do believe that is everything on the list I left with the guild. The Sons of Saint Coinach thank you, adventurer!	You \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03do\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 remember what it is you have been asked to craft, do you not? Because I, uh, do not. I am certain the list is around here somewhere, but if I had time to look for it, I wouldn't be here talking with you now, would I? How is that for logic, eh?	I do believe that is everything on the list I left with the guild.

Nothing fancy, mind you, just more of the same. If only there were someone standing directly before me with the skills necessary to complete the new order. Oh, but there is!	Well then... I suppose the blame is on me for not adding the additional items to the original list. I shall make a note to do so next time.	Allow me to fetch you a rag to wipe the grease from those elbows of yours! The Sons of Saint Coinach thank you, adventurer!

Are you sure you're using the right bait?	...But will it be \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03enough\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03? I suppose it can't hurt to have \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03too\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 much of a good thing. So, what of it, adventurer? Cast your line one more time for ol' Unsynwilf?	Well then, I won't press you. Maybe next time, eh?	Hah hah! Tonight's stew will be the greatest culinary creation in the history of Limsa Lominsa\xe2\x94\x80no, the history of man!

I'm not going to find any nasty surprises swimming amongst these, am I? One cannot be too careful, you know.	You are here, yet you have naught to deliver. I suppose you can avail yourself of my generosity and spend a few more moments about the water's edge, but just remember: I have my eye on you.	The order would seem to be fulfilled, but I would be turning my nose at a chance for good fortune if I were not to tug on the strand of fate that the Spinner has so conveniently strewn betwixt us. Might you be interested in extending our little contract?	Understood. I shall keep you no longer.	It appears my suspicions were unwarranted. It truly has been a pleasure working with you...this time. I make no guarantees for the next.

Master Gegeruju does not tolerate three things in this world: being made to wait, being made to wait, and being made to wait!	I have some good news, and some bad news. The bad news is, in my haste to find an adventurer who could obtain the items Master Gegeruju requested, I failed to remember one of his many mottos\xe2\x94\x80why have one of anything when you can have a dozen? The good news is, there is more coin to be made if you are interested. Say you are interested!	Then I can only pray that Master is too busy cuddling with his latest courtesan to notice the lack of cuisine.	Oh, the relief! The last time I forgot to double an order of fish for the master, he had me stand in a corner with a ten-ponze bucket of offal on my head for five bells straight. And that was only because he was feeling merciful.

The people of Coerthas can no longer turn away the aid of outsiders if they are to survive this everlasting winter the Calamity has brought.	Your diligence has seen the lives of several families saved, for with this fish, they will not know hunger.	I am but a lone skyfisher, and the Sea of Clouds can oft prove a harsh mistress. It is why I turn to the Adventurers' Guild to help me see my contracts with the valley families are met and that they do not starve. If the adventurer sent by the guild cannot complete \x02\x08\x0d\xe9\x05\xff\x04her\xff\x04his\x03 end of the agreement, then I may be forced to look elsewhere.	Your diligence has seen the lives of several families saved, for they will not know hunger this evening. Tomorrow, however, is another day... Unless, that is, I can somehow procure more skyfish.	That is alright. With the number of dragon attacks increasing by the day, there is no guarantee these families will even live to see tomorrow.	I thank you, and Coerthas thanks you...though it may not readily seem like it.

Say what you will about the weather, the frigid air up here does wonders for preserving the freshness of dead flesh. I could leave this order of yours in a barrel outside and the fish would still taste as if they were caught yesterday.	I care not how long it takes for you to fulfill my order. Just know that I have many others in my employ, and every delivery \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03they\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 make is another sack of coin in \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03their\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 hands when it could have been in yours.	Now that I have seen true you are a \x02\x08\x0f\xe9\x05\xff\x06woman\xff\x04man\x03 for your word, might I suggest we increase the contract? The guild need not know. I am saved the hassle, and you can have their exorbitant finder's fee.	Color me unsurprised. If I were in your shoes, I wouldn't want a reason to stay a moment longer in this damnable cold.	And here you are, the finder's fee included, just as promised.

That is what \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03you\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 are for. Oh, uh... Not that the tasks you undertake are...uh, in any way...er, menial... Er...so...uh, what have you brought us today?	Ah, yes. Fish. Always fish, isn't it. I suppose I only have myself to blame, being the one writing up the orders and all.	My colleagues cannot be expected to make the discovery of a lifetime if forced to constantly battle hunger pangs. Find us those fish, friend, so that we may fill our bellies and fuel our minds.	My powers of deduction tell me you are quite adept with that rod of yours. Could I convince you to pull it out and take it in hand once more to service the Sons of Saint Coinach?	Might it have been how I worded the request?	Rarely am I wrong, but that does not make it feel any less good when I am right, and oh, how I was right to ask you to increase the order. Well done, adventurer. I have your reward right here.

I trust you will not disappoint?	Impressive. You have proven yourself of great worth to the Holy See. I shall ready your recompense.	The lord commander did also mention that your ilk worked at your own pace. <sigh>	You unbelievers never cease to amaze. How ones so unattuned to the word of the Fury can create things that can only be described as divine...I shall never understand. Yet, I would be a fool not to ask for more of your remarkable creations.	Hm... I seem to have spoken too soon.	Why, these are even better than I imagined. I shall inform the lord commander at once...ah, after I count out your payment, of course!

Have you brought me what I asked?	These will make quite the meal! A pity it will not be me dining on them. Let me prepare your reward.	Well, then why are you not out fishing? There are hungry mouths that long to be fed!	Beautiful! These will make an amazing meal! A pity it will not be me dining on them. Unless...you were to bring me more. There appears to be some coin left over from the first order that I'm certain Sister Amianne will not be missing. What say you? Fancy another cast?	Ah, well... Thankfully my lack of good fortune is offset by the city-state's abundance of able fishers.	Oh, how I have longed for something other than beet soup, and now, thanks to your kindness and the Minister of Coin's negligence, I shall have it\xe2\x94\x80beet soup with fish!
