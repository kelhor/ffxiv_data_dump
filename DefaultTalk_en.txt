After its rider was struck down in battle, it sought shelter from the destruction raining down from the heavens, passing through the Twelveswood before arriving here in Thanalan.	During this journey, the seeds of myriad plants came to cling to its body. Though the poor goobbue succumbed to its injuries in the end, these seeds would take root and eventually sprout from its carcass.	It's amazing to see such an amalgam of species from across Eorzea. To think that such beauty could arise from that terrible tragedy... The gods do indeed work in mysterious ways.	0

In Gridania, the Order of the Twin Adder absorbed both the Wood Wailers and the Gods' Quiver, while the Lominsans enacted the complete merger of the Maelstrom and the Knights of the Barracuda.	Ul'dah is the odd nation out, having made no notable changes to its armed forces. As before, and in the spirit of the sultanate, each entity retains a certain degree of independence.	0

As he did for A Realm Reborn, Yoshitaka Amano created both the logo silhouette and concept art for Heavensward. ...And he also threw in a bonus piece above and beyond what we asked for.	This bonus art can be seen in the collector's edition\xe2\x94\x80the shiny, silver illustration. It's a cool piece, and I highly recommend you check it out. Thanks for stopping by!

But if I'm here, then where is the \xe2\x80\x9creal\xe2\x80\x9d me? Any number of theories are possible, I suppose.	It could be that the Calamity has somehow split my being in two\xe2\x94\x80half of the aether gathering here, the other half...elsewhere. The western continent, perhaps? The moon? It could be that what you see before you is but a clone, grown in some laboratorium by the selfsame scholars who created those terrible simulacra for Emperor Xande. And, it could be that this world is being generated by some ancient Allagan machine still humming away thousands of years after the fall of their civilization\xe2\x94\x80a virtual representation of the realm within which I truly reside.	Or, it could simply be that I am a song passed down by Eorzea's bards so often that I have become manifest in a method similar to how primals are summoned by the beast tribes. Or, it could be that this is all a dream...but that would be stupid. I'll have to give this further thought.	0
