Stand in the desert long enough, and an adventurer is bound to come calling. So, can one assume you are looking for employment? I am a naturalist studying the magicked aura emitted from the Sunken Temple of Qarn, and I believe this aura is what powers those stone golems which guard the entrance.	If I can learn to disrupt that aura, I may be able to render all the guardians inactive, opening the ruins for further exploration by scholars such as myself. But to do so, I first require the hearts of those very guardians, so I may study how they operate.
