26	A small bluish-grey crab found in tide pools along the La Noscean coast. Their tendency to cut fishing lines and steal bait from hooks makes these wavekin despised by fishers.	4878	135	0	12	0	1
27	An amphibious fish which can survive for bells out of water as long as its skin remains moist. When on land, the mudskipper uses its pectoral fins to \xe2\x80\x9cwander\xe2\x80\x9d about in search of shelter. Because of this trait, the fish is sometimes associated with the god Oschon.	4939	140	0	13	3	1

58	A large saltwater wavekin that roams the sea in small schools, preying on smaller fish such as anchovies or sardines. Its name comes from fishers who claim that landing an ogre barracuda is more difficult than slaying an actual ogre.	4888	134	0	25	1	1
59	Whereas other shrimp shed their old exoskeletons each summer in favor of new ones, the aegis shrimp simply adds a new layer every year until the shell is so hard, not even a blow from a trained pugilist can break through it.	4960	141	0	26	3	1
60	This freshwater fish commonly found in the rivers of the Black Shroud will often grow no larger than a mere five ilms.	4961	153	0	26	3	1
61	This deep-sea-dwelling wavekin attracts its prey with a tiny glowing appendage protruding forth from its disfigured head, and then swallows the poor victim whole with its unnaturally large mouth. It is believed that the name comes from the resemblance of the appendage to the candles monks use when transcribing manuscripts.	4889	140	0	26	1	1
62	It is said that the naturalist who first discovered the wavekin wished to name it a \xe2\x80\x9csea horse,\xe2\x80\x9d after a creature he once claimed to have seen on his travels in Ilsabard. However, when his colleagues all chided him, the crestfallen naturalist begrudgingly settled on the more common \xe2\x80\x9cchocobo.\xe2\x80\x9d	4890	137	0	26	0	1

64	A large whiskered fish that can be found in the calm marshes of the Black Shroud. It uses those whiskers to sense the movement of nearby fish, waiting patiently until one swims directly in front of it. Once close enough, the catfish will open its massive maw and swallow its prey whole.	4963	154	0	27	3	1
65	A cherry-colored saltwater fish found in abundance in all of Eorzea's five seas, though it is said those caught near Bianaq are the largest. The pinkish hue of its scales is thought to come from the finger shrimp upon which it preys.	4891	137	0	27	1	1
66	Native to the rivers and lakes of the Black Shroud, this freshwater fish uses electric receptors on its body to stun its prey. In recent years, Gridanian naturalists have begun to investigate the therapeutic properties of black ghosts, claiming that a few bells soaking in a lukewarm pool filled with the wavekin can cure various ailments.	4964	153	0	28	3	1
67	A flat bottom-feeder commonly found in the frigid waters of the Bloodbrine Sea. It earns its name from its similarity in shape to the sole of a sandal. Fortunately, its flavor resembles nothing of its namesake.	4892	135	0	28	0	1
68	A long, ugly freshwater eel found in nearly every river and lake in Eorzea. Its toothy grin is enough to frighten children across the realm.

93	A violet-hued fish found in the warmer waters of Eorzea's southern seas. It will attach itself to sharks or whales using suction cups growing from its underbelly, and feed on the scraps left by its host.	4901	137	0	36	1	1
94	The rock-hard scales of the armored pleco are thought to protect the wavekin from injury when being dashed about swift water rapids. It also prevents other predators from preying on it, allowing the fish to grow undisturbed, sometimes for decades.	4980	153	0	37	3	1
95	Significantly larger than a dark bass, landing a giant bass can prove quite the challenge for even the most seasoned angler. Not known to feed on smaller worms or lures, fishers seeking to add this trophy to their cases will first need to catch a suitable bait.	4981	156	0	37	3	1
96	A large variety of air-breathing catfish. Its near-frictionless scales allow it to swim through the sand as a normal fish would through the water.

101	Truly a prize, this bright-gold fish, though rare, can be found in rivers and lakes across Eorzea. Despite fishers believing otherwise, naturalists insist that the golden loach is not a separate species, but merely a normal loach born with a pigment deficiency in its scales.	4984	155	0	39	3	1
102	These sand-dwelling fish will skip across the desert until they are fortunate enough to stumble across a sandstorm, in which case they will spread their fins and ride the storm great distances.	5035	146	0	39	4	1
103	This freshwater eel native to the rivers and lakes of Thanalan will often display the unique trait of swapping its mate with other nearby eels when spawning. Because of this characteristic, the wavekin is oft used in religious ceremonies involving Nald'thal.	4985	145	0	39	2	1
104	A red-scaled trout commonly found in the rivers originating on Abalathia's Spine. The color of its scales led past generations to believe that the wavekin fed on the blood of other fish. The theories of the current generation, however, are just as nonsensical, the most popular being that the crimson trout is a servant of Dalamud.	4986	155	0	40	2	1
105	A colorful freshwater fish that can only survive in rivers located in more temperate climes. Though there is no proof, most believe that the fish was introduced to Eorzean waters by foreign traders from the south.	4987	137	0	40	2	1
106	This sand-dwelling slug is able to maintain its mucous coating by absorbing the moisture from prey it catches at the bottom of conical pits not unlike the ones antlions are known to dig. A famous author once wrote a novel (that he claimed was based on fact) in which antlion slugs were actually intelligent rulers of an underground kingdom.	5036	146	0	40	4	1
107	A piece of sharp coral, rarely found in any of Eorzea's five seas. The material is so rare, in fact, that it often fetches prices similar to those asked for garnets or rubies.	5462	138	0	40	0	1

233	Amalj'aa claim this plaguefish earned its grim headpiece after slaying a grown battle drake that came to water at Burnt Lizard Creek.

234	Instead of utilizing its inherent tendency to propel itself from the water and scale tiny waterfalls, this particular troublemaker will, for reasons unknown, leap forth only to strike at sylphs who have wandered too close to its home.

Lake urchins have nothing to do with this legend.	12720	397	0	125	3	1
307	This variety of warmwater catfish has scales of deep crimson which allow it to better conceal itself in the Whilom River's red clay bed. To hunt, it will sit unmoving until a smaller fish, unaware of the camouflaged wavekin's presence, comes along and impales itself upon one of the spines lining the catfish's dorsal fin.	12721	398	0	125	2	1
308	This freshwater shrimp uses its long, powerful claws to not only tear mussels from the rocks they are attached, but also pry them open and slice the containing flesh clean from the shells.	12722	398	0	125	2	1
309	Another of the Sea of Clouds' strange creatures, the starflower uses the thin blue membrane covering its body as both a sail and parachute, allowing for extended periods of wingless flight.	12723	400	0	120	6	1
310	Concerning the origins of the glacier core, there are two differing theories. One is that the icy beings are the undeveloped larvae of ice sprites. The other is that they are not living creatures at all, but lightweight spheres of manifested aether, not unlike crystals.	12724	397	0	120	5	1
311	Unable to survive in cold temperatures, the only ogre horn snails left in Coerthas are those which live in the warm waters of thermal springs.	12725	397	0	139	2	1
312	The sorcerer fish has the uncanny ability to manipulate the fire-aspected aether naturally occurring in its sanguine humours to warm the water around its body. This allows the wavekin to survive in temperatures that would most certainly mean death for lesser species.	12726	397	0	125	3	1
313	The hotrod is similar to the sorcerer fish in that it channels the fire-aspected aether found in its sanguine humours and concentrates it in the whiskers found near its head. The whiskers can then be used as a weapon to stun or even injure prey.	12727	397	0	125	2	1
314	Meaning \xe2\x80\x9cthin one\xe2\x80\x9d in the Vanu tongue, maiboi are a symbol of weakness amongst the tribes of Abalathia, and to be called a maiboi by your kin is often considered the greatest of insults.	12728	401	0	130	3	1
315	When feeding, the skin surrounding the maw of this deadly freshwater carp unfolds in three separate locations, creating a massive sac from which prey are unable to escape. The only known predator of the wavekin is the even deadlier pipira pira.	12729	398	0	130	2	1
316	So similar is a bullfrog's croak to the deep mating low of a wisent, that cows have been known to stumble into lakes at night. Though the perfect bait for mooching, these amphibious wavekin are also a delicacy amongst the Vanu tribes and often only served at guest-welcoming rituals.	12730	399	0	136	3	1
317	The Vanu believe that these fish are born of the fine rainless clouds that fill the sky in the summer months. While living, their bodies remain translucent. When taken from the water, however, the translucence is lost and the cloudfish's skin turns pure white.	12731	400	0	130	2	1
318	Mahu wai grow from the floating islands of Abalathia's Spine, releasing scores of thin transparent tendrils into the sky to catch their prey and haul it back to their giant maws. The word mahu wai means \xe2\x80\x9cbottomless greed\xe2\x80\x9d in the Vanu tongue.	12732	401	0	130	6	1

320	Pride preventing them from using the widely accepted moniker, Eorzean naturalists have come up with a much more scholarly, if no more informative, alternative to \xe2\x80\x9cflying egg.\xe2\x80\x9d As to understanding what the buoyant oviform actually is, how it flies, and how it survives...very little progress has been made.	12734	401	0	133	6	1
321	There is debate over whether this denizen of the Sea of Clouds is called a whiteloom or a whiteroom. Proponents of the former point to the spinning and weaving motions the creature makes when airborne. Proponents of the latter claim that one only need gaze upon the creature's fungus-like shape to realize that they have the right of it.	12735	401	0	130	6	1
322	This blue variety of cloud coral is harvested in great numbers by the Vanu tribes of Abalathia and ground into a fine blue powder. The powder is mixed with spring water and spores of the morrowmote to create a thick paste which is generously applied to the beaks of shamans before rituals.	12736	401	0	133	6	1
323	Spending most of their lives in near-freezing waters have lined the bodies of seema patricians with a thick layer of fatty tissue which is highly sought after by Ishgardian nobles who believe the foul-smelling oil to soften skin.	12737	397	0	130	3	1
324	An inland cousin of the nautilus, the ammonite has developed a two-layered shell which it fills with water heated by its own body. This insulates the creature from the cold, allowing it to survive in the cold northern climes.	12738	397	0	133	3	1
325	By separating its eyes from its head, the bubble eye goldfish is able to see in far more directions than other wavekin\xe2\x94\x80a trait invaluable in waters where predators might approach from any direction.	12739	401	0	133	2	1
326	As the name implies, grass carp dine solely on water grasses, shunning the carnivorous eating habits of their cousins for a healthier diet. Unfortunately, this diet gives the fish a very bitter flavor, making it unsuitable for consumption.	12740	398	0	130	2	1
327	An exceptionally ravenous variety of pipira, the pipira pira have been known to bite clean through the ankles of chocobo herds fording rivers containing schools of the deadly wavekin.	12741	398	0	145	2	1

329	To the layman's eye, the repeated pressing of perpetually puckered mouths by two of these wavekin appears to be an act of affection, when in fact, it is heated territorial dispute.	12743	400	0	133	2	1
330	Recently discovered and named by knights of House Haillenarte dispatched to explore the islets floating above Ishgard, the shells of these snail-like creatures bear a close resemblance with the holy mitre worn by the Archbishop.	12744	401	0	133	6	1
331	Only recently discovered, natural scholars are still at a loss as to how any creature, this crab included, can survive in scalding liquid rock. Tests conducted by the Thaumaturges' Guild have found that the hard carapace can withstand heat up to that generated by Fire IV.	12745	398	0	133	7	1
332	Similar to glacier cores, but with an elemental aspect of lightning instead of ice, the Vanu Vanu have, for generations, captured storm cores and placed them in baskets to serve as lighting for their homes.	12746	401	0	133	6	1
333	Before abandoning their city-state, the Sharlayans would utilize this sculpin's natural tendency to swim back and forth between two unchanging locations in search of prey to deliver messages up and down the Thaliak River.	12747	398	0	133	3	1
334	A highly intelligent wavekin with an enormous appetite, the gigant grouper will repeatedly butt its head against the underside of a frozen lake, weakening the ice so that when a large creature such as a polar bear lumbers by, it will fall through, providing a hearty meal.	12748	397	0	136	3	1
335	The first explorers of the floating Abalathian island mistook this fish with a massive lump upon its forehead to be a diving Vanu Vanu, hence the moniker. Interestingly enough, the Vanu Vanu call this fish \xe2\x80\x9cduku'moii,\xe2\x80\x9d which means \xe2\x80\x9cswimming bottom dweller.\xe2\x80\x9d	12749	401	0	136	2	1
336	Marble oscars will often gather in water that has been clouded by spilled blood, leading the Gnath to believe the wavekin a loyal servant of the Lord of the Hive, Ravana.	12750	398	0	136	3	1
337	Unlike gigantoads, newts, or nankas which, by exhibiting properties of both wave- and scalekin, are able to survive in and out of water, the lung fish is a rare example of a wavekin that, despite being void of scalekin properties, can still survive for extended periods on dry land\xe2\x94\x80sometimes for several summers.	12751	402	0	180	3	1
338	This violent freshwater fish was dubbed the tigerfish by a group of Auri travelers who claim the striped pattern on the wavekin's back resembles that of a Far Eastern beast known as a tiger.	12752	399	0	136	3	1
339	While many an Ishgardian lay has been sung about the beauty of these ephemeral creatures, sky faeries are detested by the Vanu tribes of Abalathia who find them to be grotesque and misshapen monstrosities.	12753	401	0	130	6	1

342	A shell-less bivalve mollusk notorious for boring into ship hulls. Despite the use of protective measures such as ironwood bug shoes or metal plating, the vermiform creatures will eventually find a way into any ship, slowly consuming it from the inside.	12756	399	0	136	2	1
343	This tiny vilekin has the capacity to live on both land and in water, using its powerful barbed forelegs to both burrow and to swim. Its reproductive capacity is immense; however, since both fish and birds feed on the cricket, its population remains fairly controlled.	12757	399	0	130	2	1

348	An extremely rare form of freshwater puffer found only in the cold waters beyond the Coerthan lowlands. Ishgardian nobles believe that the fish bring fortune, and many have elaborate tanks built in their manors so that they may gaze upon the wavekin as they count their gil.	12762	397	0	136	3	1
349	The snowcaller will wait in the mud at the bottom of lakes until the water temperature drops, numbing the movement of those fish who are less tolerant to the cold. It is then that the snowcaller will rise from its warm bed and attack.	12763	397	0	136	3	1

353	This breed of ancient wavekin is covered in brilliant diamond-shaped scales that blind potential predators. Bichirs feed solely on water-skipping vilekin, making them much hated by the Gnath, who will spear them merely out of spite and leave the corpses to rot in the water.	12767	398	0	139	3	1
354	No more than a marble oscar lacking pigment, noontide oscars are rare finds simply for the fact that they are unable to blend in with their surroundings, making them more visible to predators. There are those, however, who claim the bone-white wavekin possess special powers, making them highly sought after by witches and medicine men.	12768	400	0	139	3	1
355	One cannot visit a tavern in all of Coerthas without hearing tall tales of the great man-eating shadowhisker. In one village, the fish will be five yalms long, in another, five wide.

356	This strange floating octopus appears to have abandoned the dangers of the Deep for the freedom of the firmament. When turned on its side, it bears a striking resemblance to a goblin's mask, begging the question, \xe2\x80\x9cWhich came first?

357	Its name taken from the serpent-haired seductress of ancient legend, the blue medusa is an anemone-like creature which survives on the underbellies of Abalathia's floating islets. Its tentacles are covered in poisonous barbs which petrify prey, making it easier to seize, devour, and digest.	12771	400	0	139	6	1
358	The metallic scales covering this lava-dwelling snail closely resemble those of the deep sea snail known as the armorer, leading naturalists to hypothesize that at one time, sea levels were much higher, and that when the waters receded, snails left atop mountains began evolving separately.	12772	398	0	139	7	1
359	The violent flagellating motion of this snakelike creature's tail is most likely a means to detect nearby obstacles, as its eyes have regressed into naught more than skin-covered pits on the sides of its head.	12773	402	0	139	8	1
360	Naturalists who have had the opportunity to examine the rare samples brought back from Azys Lla have come to the tentative conclusion that despite being several times smaller, a completely different color, and bearing strange whisker-like fins, this amphibious creature is most likely a distant relative to the axolotls that reside in lower Eorzea.	12774	402	0	150	3	1
361	Writings extracted from recently discovered tomestones state that this particular breed of helmet crab was biologically altered by Allagans to produce an impenetrable shell that could be harvested for armor production.	12775	402	0	139	8	1
362	Believed to be a cousin of the goldfish, the platinum fish has fully adapted to life in the corrupted waters of Azys Lla's aetherochemical pools and now requires the aetherially charged liquid to survive. The dazzling sheen of its scales does not appear to be hereditary, however, and rather a result of an aetherochemical reaction caused by the pools.	12776	402	0	139	8	1
363	Due to its lack of eyes, it was once thought this fish hunted like a bat, using sound to navigate the pools in which it lives. However, the popular theory amongst naturalists now is that it instead utilizes a strange organ on its head to detect concentrations of aether.	12777	402	0	139	2	1
364	A fish so filled with poison that it will seep from the wavekin's body, fouling the waters in which it swims. The Azysfish will feed on the corpses of those creatures who fall victim to the deadly venom.	12778	402	0	139	8	1
365	Unlike glassfins which all have transparent appendages, fin transparency of crystalfins varies depending on the type of aether concentrated within the fish. Diet, habitat, even weather can change the outward appearance of crystalfins, which is why for so long it was believed that there were as many as six different species.	12779	402	0	145	2	1
366	Why the Sharlayan called the sweetfish by that name is unknown, as the fish is in no way sweet, whether eaten raw or cooked. They are, however, delicious\xe2\x94\x80a trait that has resulted in overfishing. Large fish introduced into Dravanian waters by goblins have also contributed to the dwindling population of sweetfish.	12780	399	0	136	2	1
367	Native to the lakes of the Orn Wild, the Sharlayans brought scores of the billowy-finned wavekin down from the north to populate their ornamental fountains. When the Sharlayans returned to their homeland, most were left to die...but nature had other plans.	12781	399	0	142	3	1
368	A circular mane consisting of several tiny fins sprout from the head of this rare wavekin. For reasons known only to themselves, moogles detest the hundred fin, believing it to be an augur of death, destruction, and mayhem of the most unplayful variety.	12782	400	0	142	3	1
369	This fish uses its uncanny resemblance to a reddened leaf to hide amongst fallen detritus and wait for unsuspecting prey to approach. As this hunting technique is only effective for a two-moon period of the twelvemoon, the wavekin will gorge itself while it can, and then lie dormant until the next autumn calls.	12783	399	0	142	3	1
370	Manasails achieve flight by spreading their elastic fins like sails of a ship to gather wind-aspected aether from the clouds. Most spend their lives atop thermals rising high above floating islets of Abalathia and Dravania, and are rarely seen by even the denizens of those skyey regions.	12784	400	0	139	6	1
371	Sky sweepers are one of the few creatures living in the Sea of Clouds that do not actually have the capability of flight. These shark-like beings are spawned on the backs of larger flying fish, where they spend their entire lives feeding on vilekin and sloughed-off skin.	12785	401	0	142	6	1
372	As does its cousin the aetherlouse, the magma louse also feeds on minute traces of aether bled from wounds in Hydaelyn's crust, the most common aspects being fire and earth.	12786	398	0	142	7	1
373	While it is rumored this tortoise's shell is so hard that it can withstand the impact of a comet, the wavekin's name is derived from the creature's natural tendency to remain motionless for up to several moons to conserve energy when forage is scarce.	12787	398	0	142	7	1
374	Unlike anything else on Eorzea, compound #123 is thought to be another of the Allagan Empire's failed chimeric creations. The creature seems to be harmless enough, feeding only on the tiny water lice which inhabit Azys Lla's aetherochemical pools. Its outer hide, however, has given many a naturalist pause as it bears a texture almost identical to that of a Lalafell's skin.	12788	402	0	142	8	1
375	For most of the sun's turn, the brown bolo will hang stationary from the bottoms of Azys Lla's floating landmasses. When prey flies or floats by, however, the bolo will throw itself from the crags and wrap around the unsuspecting victim, choking it into submission before propelling itself back to the crag face to feed.	12789	400	0	142	6	1
376	This pink-shelled mollusk earned its playful moniker when a group of alchemy students attending one of Sharlayan's academies submitted several of the wavekin for their graduation projects after spending several moons drinking and whoring on Ul'dah's Pearl Lane.	12790	399	0	142	2	1
377	Massive lungs and a siphon-like mouth combine to create a powerful jet that the fountfish can use to propel pressurized water at targets on land or in the air. While the water cannot penetrate deep enough to kill an animal, it will breach the skin, causing a target to bleed. It is this blood upon which the fountfish survives.	12791	402	0	145	3	1
378	Despite the abundance of other, easier-to-land wavekin in Dravanian waters, Weston bowfin are actively sought by moogle anglers\xe2\x94\x80not for the fish themselves, but for the bright-red eggs which remind the moogles of their pom-poms.	12792	400	0	145	3	1
379	Legend states that letter puffers were once so abundant in the skies above Dravania that clouds of the creatures would blot out the sun. Rampant hunting to collect the volatile gas contained within their bellies drove the puffers to near extinction, and only recently have their numbers begun to grow.	12793	400	0	145	6	1
380	The only method currently known of distinguishing between a star and a sky faerie is by observing the color of their abdomens. Claims that the star faerie has the flavor of rolanberries have been attributed to a psychological phenomenon that compels individuals to think that something red will taste like something similarly colored.	12794	400	0	145	5	1
381	Another colored variety of cloud coral found growing on the floating islands above Eorzea, gloaming coral's deep red is a favorite of moogle artists who grind the creature's exoskeleton into a red pigment that can be used in painting rocks.	12795	400	0	145	6	1
382	This freshwater octopus feeds mainly on the shellfish residing on the beds of glacial lakes. However, when food is scarce, they will leave the water to dig for clams on the frozen shores. This, unfortunately, makes them easy targets for yeti who will dash the octopodes on rocks and then swallow them whole.	12796	397	0	145	3	1
383	Sight of this dragon-like creature has sent many an alarum ringing, watch-moogles mistaking them for Horde scouts...which normally would be unthinkable, as dragon's souls average only a few ilms in length.	12797	400	0	145	6	1
384	It has recently been suggested that many of Eorzea's sudden and unexplained wind-aspected aetherial disturbances are not natural occurrences, but actually flying sharks with the capacity of manipulating aether. Enough said.	12798	401	0	180	6	1
385	This jellyfish's striking resemblance to an Ixali warballoon suggests that inspiration for the beast tribe's dirigibles came upon witnessing the wavekin floating hither and thither about the heavens.	12799	397	0	145	5	1
386	In order to survive the extreme temperatures that would render a normal fish to cinders, the fossiltongue has developed a thick layer of stone scales that cover the wavekin's entire body, including its eyes. To locate its prey, it swims with its fossil-like tongue jut out constantly before it, taking in anything it touches, regardless of whether it is edible or not.	12800	398	0	145	7	1
387	A strange fish that bears an eerie resemblance to the sea-dwelling hropken. Judging from the extensive cloning experiments conducted by the Allagans during their Fourth Astral Era reign, it is entirely feasible that hropkens were an Allagan creation and that this fish represents one of the ungodly stages of hropken development.	12801	402	0	145	8	1
388	This snap-jawed scalekin sits atop of the aquatic food chain, feeding on whatever (or whomever!?) crosses his path. The caiman fears no retribution, for there is none who might topple him from his lofty throne. None, that is, of course, except dragons, for even a king must learn to bow his head to the gods.	12802	398	0	145	2	1
389	A variety of pirarucu specially bred by the Allagans for mass consumption. Characteristics include a natural tendency to remain near the water's surface (to allow for quick retrieval), heightened reproductivity, rapid maturation, nutrient-rich flesh, and an easily removable skeleton (for efficient deboning).	12803	402	0	180	3	1
390	Selective breeding by the goblin scholars known as the Illuminati have created a new variety of perch so foul smelling that only someone wearing a specially crafted gas mask (conveniently such as a gobbie mask) might withstand the noxious vapors long enough to enjoy the rich, buttery flesh.	12804	399	0	145	2	1
391	Blindingly fast and possessing almost inexhaustible stamina, the rudderfish is a favorite tool for mother dragons teaching their pups to hunt in the air.	12805	400	0	145	6	1
392	Floating like mines in the skies above Azys Lla, bomb puffers will literally explode when set upon by predators, sacrificing their lives to impale their assailants with countless deadly spines. However, the sacrifice is not without purpose. Within those spines are scores of tiny eggs which hatch within the body of the poisoned corpse, and feed on its flesh until old enough to emerge and fly away.	12806	402	0	148	6	1
393	Unlike the case with other fish living in the Azys Lla's aetherochemical sludge, the mucous minnow will perish if exposed to the liquid for even a short period of time. Luckily for this wavekin, it is born covered in a viscous transparent barrier which not only protects the minnow, but also acts as a filter, allowing the wavekin to absorb waterborne algae.	12807	402	0	145	8	1
394	Also known as a UFB, the numerous attempts to identify this hovering clam have all been unsuccessful, the worst case resulting in a septuagenarian scholar falling several thousand yalms from a floating islet onto a highland haycock. Most of the hay was salvaged from the accident. The scholar was not.	12808	402	0	150	6	1
395	Found only in warm waters, this tiny fish feeds mainly on algae and other aquatic flora. In extreme cases, however, the wavekin will eat the dead skin off of animals wading in their habitat. Ishgardian chirurgeons have been known to use this survival trait to their advantage, applying the fish to festering wounds so that they may devour the corrupted flesh.	12809	397	0	145	3	1
396	The scorpionfly exhibits the peculiar habit of flying its prey to an islet different from the one upon which it subdues its meal. Naturalists guess that this may be done to keep future prey unaware of the threat the scorpionfly poses, making it easier to return to the islet at a later date and hunt with relative ease.	12810	401	0	145	6	1
397	The rockclimber uses a suction cup on its underbelly to climb up rocks. Once in position, it will wait until an insect flies by, and then leap into the air, catch the morsel in its mouth and land safely back in the water.	12811	402	0	145	3	1
398	Blood skippers will use a set of highly developed pelvic fins to periodically \xe2\x80\x9cwalk\xe2\x80\x9d forth from their pools in search of new homes. Such a journey from the water's protective depths would normally leave a creature exposed to land-dwelling predators. Fortunately for the blood skipper, the extreme toxicity of its flesh discourage all but the most hungry.	12812	402	0	145	8	1
399	Measuring up to several yalms long, the cobrafish's dorsal fin is covered in thousands of hair-like feelers which are thought to absorb airborne concentrations of wind-aspected aether. The collected energy is then distributed evenly throughout the body to create a temporary state of weightlessness which enables flight via the \xe2\x80\x9cflapping\xe2\x80\x9d of the pectoral and pelvic fins.	12813	400	0	148	6	1

401	When assaulted by a predator, the oil eel will release copious amounts of a slick, mucous-like substance that prevents adequate purchase, allowing the wavekin to escape. Despite what the name suggests, the secreted substance does not actually contain any oil.	12815	402	0	148	8	1
402	Strictly a nocturnal hunter, this luminescent jellyfish uses the colorful light emitted by its body to lure insects and small fish into its inescapable web of poisonous tentacles.	12816	402	0	148	8	1
403	With fins like billowing sails and a mouth like an armored ramming prow, this large freshwater fish not only has the appearance of a Lominsan battle galley, but also the strength\xe2\x94\x80repeatedly butting larger prey until stunned and susceptible to attack.	12817	397	0	148	2	1
404	From claw to tail, the length of this freshwater crustacean often exceeds a full yalm when fully grown. While not as succulent as the meat from smaller lobsters, a single tail can feed a Lalafellin family of seven or a single Roegadyn adolescent.	12818	398	0	148	3	1
405	A ferociously territorial fish, the hinterlands perch currently finds itself in a heated battle with several goblin-introduced foreign species over dominion of the waters of lower Dravania.	12819	399	0	150	3	1
406	An ancient tome on culinary legend kept on display at the Bismarck tells the story of a man who climbed the highest peak in Abalathia's Spine to catch the mythical catfish which swim the red-hot blood of Hydaelyn herself. Upon drawing the fish from the lake of lava, he found the fish was already cooked, and proceeded to devour it, for the journey into the heart of the mountain had left him famished.	12820	398	0	148	7	1
407	If sketches in ancient bestiaries are to be believed, this scalekin has changed very little over the past several millennia, leading some to believe that it is of the same blood as the dragons. This has, however, been disproven, the flying lizards possessing about as much intelligence as the average ninki nanka.	12821	400	0	145	6	1
408	The wings of this flying fish are almost completely made up of concentrated aether\xe2\x94\x80aether that dissipates once the fish has been caught, leaving naught but a skeletal frame.	12822	401	0	148	6	1
409	Though found solely in the hyperborean reaches of Eorzea, the spring urchin can only survive in the heated waters of geothermal springs. A good number of the shrill howls that fill the Coerthan nights are from yeti who mistakenly step on the urchins' spiked shells when wading through the natural baths.	12823	397	2500	180	3	1
410	Contrary to popular belief, the cherry trout is actually named after the pinkish-red hue of its underbelly. And so doth continue mankind's never-ending search for a cherry-flavored fish.	12824	397	0	148	3	1
411	This rare tortoise's ability of flight is granted by its fabulous shell made up of solid wind crystal. As long as the shell remains undamaged, the scalekin will remain aloft; however, the moment even the smallest of scratches are suffered, it will plummet back to Hydaelyn.	12825	402	2502	180	6	1
412	Similar to how the sorcerer fish is able to manipulate its body's fire-aspected aether, the black magefish is able to tap into the ice-aspected aether contained in its phlegmatic humours to perpetually cool its body, allowing it to survive in otherwise deadly molten lava.	12826	398	0	150	7	1
413	The braincase of this dome-headed fish is, unlike the rest of its body, completely transparent and filled with a gel-like substance in which the eyes float. The lack of any even remotely similar creatures in all of the Three Great Continents suggests that this creature may be another one of the Allagan Empire's terrible creations.	12827	402	2502	180	8	1
414	While able to generate an electric charge with its body, this wavekin does not utilize that charge to subdue its prey, but rather locate it by detecting how the electric waves change after being released. Once the eel has determined where its prey is, it will wrap itself about the creature and strangle it.	12828	398	0	150	2	1
415	The catkiller is a freshwater pike which uses its long, whip-like dorsal fin to impale gaelicats who fly too close to the water's surface. Formerly called a \xe2\x80\x9cgaelicatkiller,\xe2\x80\x9d the amalgamation of three different words into one was deemed by naturalist circles far too difficult to read and subsequently shortened to its current (albeit equally unceremonious) moniker.	12829	401	0	150	3	1
416	This colossal wavekin is, in fact, little more than a common bonytongue that has grown to an enormous size in the relatively safe waters of the Dravanian hinterlands. This phenomenon, however, has allowed scholars to form a correlation between the size of a bonytongue and the softness of its tongue.	12830	398	2501	180	3	1
417	Whereas most of the known world shies away from the fetid odor emitted by Illuminati perch, the Thaliak caiman seems drawn to it, refusing to eat any other manner of flesh if a perch is detected in the vicinity. This eating habit has made the scalekin a target of Illuminati fishers, who will employ heavy crossbows in an attempt to protect the fish (that they eventually plan on catching and eating themselves).	12831	399	0	150	2	1
418	Even with several live specimens having been caught and returned to Ul'dah for further study, many naturalists still deny the existence of magma-dwelling fish such as the lavalord, and dismiss the finding of their peers as lies concocted to gain fame.	12832	398	2501	180	7	1
419	All existing samples of the tupuxuara\xe2\x94\x80an ancient breed of wyvern\xe2\x94\x80have been discovered in the Aetherochemical Research Facility on Azys Lla. If these were indeed created in the Allagan Empire's laboratories, it would make the creatures several thousand years old.	12833	402	0	150	6	1
420	Despite the fear-inducing moniker, this flying cephalopod neither sups on blood nor transforms into a bat. Rumors that it does not cast a shadow are unfounded, and all manner of stakes, from oak, to iron, to granite, to cermet, have been found effective in impaling this rather peaceful creature of the clouds.	12834	401	0	150	6	1
421	Inside the storm chaser's belly lives a unique type of yeast which breaks down food to create a lighter-than-air gas which allows the fish to float. Short bursts of this gas from its rectum are used for propulsion. Yes, you read that correctly.	12835	400	0	180	6	1
422	Sharlayan scholars deemed the berserker betta to be one of the most violent breeds of the already infamously violent family of betta. Despite having little to no chance of subduing a target, berserker betta will repeatedly attack fish three to four times larger than itself. This natural-born stubbornness has ensured the berserker population remains relatively small.	12836	399	2501	180	2	1
423	During spawning season, a female capelin's belly will be so full of eggs that the fish will almost double in size, making the wavekin a favorite amongst egg-loving Qiqirn.	12837	397	2500	180	3	1
