131	Mini Cactpot rules are simple. First, you select three numbers from the eight hidden on your ticket. Next, you select one of eight lines\xe2\x94\x80vertical, horizontal, or diagonal.
132	Once you've selected a line, all the numbers are uncovered with the sum of the three in the line you chose determining your MGP payout. It's that easy!
133	Now all that's left is to select a four-digit number. The winning number will be selected at a later date. If the last digit of your number matches the winning number, you win 4th prize. If the last two match, you win 3rd prize. If the last three match, you win 2nd, and if all your numbers match, you take home the grand prize.
