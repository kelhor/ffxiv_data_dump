They need not be of Ishgard, only of sound body and mind.	You seem barely able to walk, let alone wield a sword or sorcery. Begone.	May the Fury give you strength.	The Temple Knights will not waste time entertaining untested whelps, no matter how willing they may be.	Word of your performance in the field has been received. I shall prepare your reward accordingly.	0	0	The levemetes report that not only did you encounter a wanted mark, but slew the bastard, as well. I applaud your bravery, adventurer.
