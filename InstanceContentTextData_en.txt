1000	Cultist Rosaries
1001	Cultist orbs destroyed
1002	Sealed barriers broken
1003	You seem surprised. Did you not cross our gates in search of blood?
1004	Come hither, children of the dawn. The undying master will drink deep tonight!
1100	Tiny Keys
1101	Find the bloody parchment
1102	Find the green key
1103	Find the yellow key
1200	Photocells
1201	Activate Confession Chamber terminal
1202	Open the Abacination Chamber door
1203	Activate the Fool's Rest terminal
1300	The guildhest is complete! Come and collect your reward.
1301	Eliminate all targets.
1302	Slay \x021\x10\xff\x09BNpcName\x03\xe8\x02\x02\x02\x03.
1303	Capture \x021\x10\xff\x09BNpcName\x03\xe8\x02\x02\x02\x03.
1304	Escort \x021\x10\xff\x09BNpcName\x02\xe8\x02\x02\x02\x03 to the specified location.
1305	A fine display! Now come, collect your reward.
1306	Done, are we?\x02\x10\x01\x03Then haul your bloody arses over here so's we can leave this awful place!
1307	That was...adequate. Back to me, adventurer.
1308	You've a knack for this, haven't you? 'Twas as if I were watching myself, ten summers past!
1400	Defeat one enemy group at a time.
1401	If \x021\x10\xff\x09BNpcName\x03\xe8\x02\x02\x02\x03 spots you, he will order all remaining targets to attack. Stay out of his line of sight and tackle his minions one at a time.
1402	If \x021\x10\xff\x09BNpcName\x03\xe8\x02\x02\x02\x03 spots you, he will order all remaining targets to attack. Stay out of his line of sight and tackle his minions one at a time.
1403	Steady there! Only a fool with a death wish would engage both parties at once!
1404	\xe6\x9c\xaa\xe4\xbd\xbf\xe7\x94\xa8
1405	Don't be so bloody eager to march headlong into peril! Try luring the beasts away from the goobbue without alarming the mossy lout.
1406	Executed to perfection! Now put the seedkin down!
1407	The goobbue has seen you and alerted his scrags! Slay as many as you can before jumpin' in bed with the giant, or you won't survive another bell!
1408	Get up! You won't do your allies any good lying sprawled across the grass like a beached whale!
1409	What in the seven hells are you fools doing!? Fall back and regroup!
1410	Might be I was mistaken about you all. I'd say your chances of victory are a notch above dismal.
1411	You've come this far, now finish him!
1500	When threatened, \x021\x10\xff\x09BNpcName\x03\xe8\x02\x02\x02\x03 will summon reinforcements. Stay alert!
1501	Beware of \x021\x10\xff\x09BNpcName\x03\xe8\x02\x02\x02\x03's new weaponskill.
1502	Beware of \x021\x10\xff\x09BNpcName\x03\xe8\x02\x02\x02\x03's new weaponskill.
1503	The stronger of your allies would be wise to draw the enemy's attention away from the weaker.
1504	Those allies specialized in dealing damage will find their attacks more effective when dealt from the enemy's flank or rear.
1505	Reinforcements! Move to intercept!
1506	Another wave! But unlike the last!
1600	Defeat \x021\x10\xff\x09BNpcName\x03\xe8\x02\x03\x02\x03 to open the first gate.
1601	Defeat the enemies and use the lever to open the gate.
1602	Defeat \x021\x10\xff\x09BNpcName\x03\xe8\x02\x02\x02\x03 before the yarzons break free.
1603	Behind you! Slay the lesser enemies before concentrating your efforts on the true threat.
1604	Pull the lever and open the gate!
1605	Quickly! Those boulders will not hold the yarzons back for long!
1606	There to the left of the gate! A second swarm of yarzons has appeared! Hurry and fell the gigantoad or you will have the vilekin to deal with, as well.
1607	A swarm of yarzons has broken through! Your attention is best focused on clearing away the eight-legged vilekin before returning to the gigantoad.
1608	A second swarm approaches quickly! Ready yourselves!
1609	A superb display of strength and speed! Well done!
1610	The boulders are beginning to crack!
1611	The boulders will crumble at any moment, allowing the yarzons entry!
1612	Now pull the lever to open the gate...but only when you are ready for what waits on the other side.
1613	My orders are to aid you to victory. You only make it harder on yourselves by disregarding them.
1614	Now that those two are out of the way, concentrate your efforts on the hog.
1615	Something tells me there will be more if you cannot make swift work of that toad.
1616	The first gate is open! Tend to your wounds before advancing to the second.
1617	The second gate is open! One more, and you will have breached the gigantoad's lair.
1618	The third gate has fallen! The lord of the lair awaits beyond!
1619	The safety mechanism on the gate will deactivate once all threats in the area have been removed.
1700	\x02+\x16\xff\x14\x021\x10\xff\x09BNpcName\x03\xe8\x02\x03\x02\x03\x03 will attempt to heal \x021\x10\xff\x09BNpcName\x03\xe8\x03\x02\x02\x03.
1701	Use fire sprite cores to light the herb patch and release slumber-inducing smoke into the air.
1702	Your orders are to capture the gil turtle. The best manner in which to accomplish this task is by first weakening the poor creature.
1703	The craven bandits who spirited away the turtle would not have you reclaim their prize, and will heal the creature's wounds with hopes that their efforts will discourage you into leaving. Draw the turtle away from the conjurers.
1704	In its current weakened state, the gil turtle will be unable to resist the effects of the herbs. Now quickly! We require fire sprite cores!
1705	Use the core to light the herb patch lying before me.
1706	The herbs are aflame! Now do what you must to draw the gil turtle into the smoke!
1707	And so the gentle giant succumbs to slumber's blissful embrace. Our work here is complete.
1708	Those efts may prove troublesome if left alone. Slay the wavekin before the situation becomes problematic.
1709	Out of cores? Well then claim new ones! You'd think that much was obvious!
1710	Stay your blades!\x02\x10\x01\x03The client specifically stated that he wished his pet returned alive!
1711	You blundering half-wits! Now what are we to tell Lord Adeledji!
1712	The smoke will have little effect on the turtle while in his current condition.
1713	Releasing the smoke now would be useless. I shall tend to the herbs while you see to the gil turtle.
1714	Fire sprite cores
1715	Silence those bandits!
1800	Lure enemies away from the ruptured pollen clusters before engaging them.
1801	Stay clear of the ruptured pollen clusters when engaging enemies.
1802	If inhaled the pollen will set fire to your lungs and sap your strength. Draw the creatures a safe distance from the noisome mist and then engage.
1803	Do not let down your guard. The battle has only just begun.
1804	It may take some coercing to draw that one from the mist.
1805	Leave the mist at once! You will need all your strength to defeat these horrors of the wood!
1806	Maneuver clear of the raining pollen clusters lest you find yourself caught in their mist!
1807	The wind! It carries away the mist! The Matron smiles upon us!
1808	The mist, it returns!
1809	The creature has left the pollen mist!\x02\x10\x01\x03Now is your chance! Strike it down!
1810	Your foe weakens with every blow you land! Do not let up!
1811	Yes! I do believe you have him! It won't be much longer now!
1900	Defeat the roaming bandits before engaging the stationary targets.
1901	Beware of reinforcements.
1902	Prevent the conjurers from healing their wounded companions.
1903	Redbellies! To me!
1904	My wounds! Someone see to my wounds!
1905	Where are all my men!?
1906	Ware the scouts, for they will alert their brethren of your presence.
1907	The swarmpoint has summoned reinforcements! Locate them immediately!
1908	Their conjurers will spell your end. Silence the casters so that there are none who might heal the swarmpoint.
1909	Keep your eyes open for roaming bandits who will join the fray! Remember this when situating your battles.
1910	Without their conjurers to heal them, you should make quick work of the others.
1911	The swarmpoint is known for his unmatchable strength. Send your hardiest allies to bear the brunt of his might while the others slowly drain his vitality.
1912	Reinforcements!\x02\x10\x01\x03See to the conjurers before your efforts are rendered to naught.
1913	Another unit! You know what you must do!
1914	Not all their spellweavers are masters of the curative arts. Learn to distinguish the healers from the rest!
1915	Lo! There is a conjurer in your midst! Find the cur and slay him!
1916	
2000	Use the guild-issue items to your advantage.
2001	Take care not to succumb to the enfeebling effects of the charmed creatures' attacks.
2002	Beware the enfeebling properties of Briaxio's attacks.
2003	Reinforcements called
2004	Beware! The foul poisons of these creatures will disrupt your humours and send your body into fits.
2005	Do not let the poisons overwhelm you! Use the time between battles to purge the toxins from your veins.
2006	Confirm that each of your allies knows his role. One misstep could mean a man poisoned, paralyzed...or worse!
2007	Use the spell Esuna to your advantage! And if that fails you, a good old antidote will often do the trick.
2008	Without an ally to draw his magicks away from the others, Briaxio will unleash his bane on all of you!
2009	Briaxio's followers have rushed to his aid! Send several of your allies to drive off the reinforcements while those remaining keep Briaxio under control.
2100	Destroy the goblins' makeshift barricades and continue up the Matron's Lethe.
2101	Avoid Stikflix Grumblytoss's bombs.
2102	The goblins hide behind their barricades. You must destroy these obstacles to reach them. However, be always aware of their bombs.
2103	The bombs wielded by Stikflix Grumblytoss are much deadlier and have a greater blast radius than those used by his rag-tag army.
2104	Remember your roles within the party and communicate with your allies. Those are the keys to victory!
2105	If a bomb is tossed your way, do not panic. Simply retreat until it detonates and then return to the front lines.
2106	I shall give the goblins credit where credit is due. It must have taken them a half turn of the sun to drag these crates into place... Now demolish them!
2107	The first station is toppled, but another lies near the top of the heavenspillar. Forward, adventurers!
2108	The goblins' leader, Stikflix Grumblytoss, awaits ahead! Give him no quarter!
2109	Stikflix Grumblytoss may not appear to be the most formidable of foes, but his realm-shaking explosives make him a force to be reckoned with. If one happens to land in your vicinity, you would take my advice and run.
2110	
2200	Rotten jam will emerge from the stale bubbles if ignored. Burst them before they burst on their own.
2201	When burst, acid bubbles will emit a harmful, corrosive liquid. Avoid attacking them at all costs.
2202	Rotten jam! That's why I warned you to burst the stale bubbles. Now you have that \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03thing\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 to deal with!
2203	That wasn't so hard now, was it?
2204	What did the damn morbol do, pass wind!?\x02\x10\x01\x03See to the bubbles afore they see to you!
2205	I reckon you've done this before.\x02\x10\x01\x03That was some proper combat, if I do say so meself.
2206	What are you fixing to do? Get us all killed?
2207	Not another! Just the smell alone is enough to make a man retch! Do away with the thing, would you?
2208	The stale bubbles, not the acid bubbles, you mud-brained dullard!
2209	Send the damned thing back to the hell it slithered up from!
2210	Good eyes, adventurers! Good eyes!
2211	Not the most pleasant buggers to fight, are they? Maybe next time you'll heed me words and burst the bubbles first.
2212	See the bastard's vines start to twitch? The creature grows weak!
2213	Leave them stale bubbles be, and from them'll drop a dollop of rancid ooze almost as foul as me ma's gruel. If you don't want to see that happen, burst the bubbles quick.
2300	Buso draws his strength from the blue flames. Extinguish the flames to make him more susceptible to your attacks.
2301	A new blue flame will appear where \x021\x10\xff\x09BNpcName\x02\xe8\x02\x02\x02\x03 is slain. Choose your battles.
2302	If you are branded with Buso's Mark of Pain, distance yourself from your allies so that they are not caught in the Dark Dome.
2303	Those horrible blue flames\xe2\x94\x80they're the aetherial traces of slain voidsent. Our Lifestream won't have the stuff, so the essence remains trapped in the corporeal realm. Buso taps that essence...
2304	You cannot slay a void hound without it leaving behind a flame. If you are to cull the beasts, be ready to deal swiftly with the consequences of your actions.
2305	Buso readies the Mark of Pain! Once marked, you cannot escape the fate you are dealt...but you can spare your allies!
2306	Go! Smother the blue flames!\x02\x10\x01\x03It's the only way to see Buso weakened!
2307	Damn! Another blue flame is lit!\x02\x10\x01\x03Buso grows stronger every moment he basks in its unholy light!
2308	Rise up, adventurer!\x02\x10\x01\x03This battle is not yet lost! Remember the blue flames!
2309	Only one flame remains! Quickly! See it out!
2310	Now is your chance!\x02\x10\x01\x03Tear the fiend limb from limb...from limb from limb!
2311	Buso seeks to mark those allies who douse his flames!
2312	One of you has been marked!\x02\x10\x01\x03For Twelve's sake and the sake of the others, run!
2313	Thrust him back into the void!
2314	Draw Buso away from the blue flames before extinguishing them!

3000	Engage the shadowclaw.
3001	Avoid the invincible \x021\x10\xff\x09BNpcName\x04\xe8\x02\x02\x02\x03 and focus your attacks on the shadowclaw.
3002	Avoid the invincible \x021\x10\xff\x09BNpcName\x04\xe8\x02\x02\x02\x03 and focus your attacks on the shadowclaw.
3003	Avoid the invincible \x021\x10\xff\x09BNpcName\x04\xe8\x02\x02\x02\x03 and focus your attacks on the shadowclaw.
3004	\x02+\x16\xff\x14\x021\x10\xff\x09BNpcName\x03\xe8\x02\x02\x02\x03\x03 is all you need be concerned with. Shut all else out.
3005	\x02+\x16\xff\x14\x021\x10\xff\x09BNpcName\x02\xe8\x02\x02\x02\x03\x03... Ware his attacks, but do not let the fiend lure you from your objective.
3006	\x02+\x16\xff\x14\x021\x10\xff\x09BNpcName\x03\xe8\x02\x03\x02\x03\x03 wander twixt this realm and theirs, appearing only for a few moments. Pay them no heed, and they will pay you none in turn. Draw too close, and...
3007	Do not be lured in by \x021\x10\xff\x09BNpcName\x03\xe8\x02\x02\x02\x03's dance. Keep your distance and keep your head.
3008	Can you not see your blows to \x021\x10\xff\x09BNpcName\x03\xe8\x02\x02\x02\x03 have no effect? Avoid its attacks and concentrate your efforts on the shadowclaw.
3009	\x02+\x16\xff\x14\x021\x10\xff\x09BNpcName\x03\xe8\x02\x02\x02\x03\x03's magicks can smother the field of battle. Stay light on your feet.
3010	Watch carefully. Order can be discovered in the shadows' movements, if you would but seek it.
3011	You are doing well. The beast weakens.
3012	There is little life left in this one, but do not let down your guard. The battle is far from over.
3013	Never before have I seen such mastery of the battlefield. You have far exceeded my expectations, adventurers.
3100	\x02+\x16\xff\x14\x021\x10\xff\x09BNpcName\x03\xe8\x02\x02\x02\x03\x03 will appear once her subjects are slain.
3101	Watch for \x021\x10\xff\x09BNpcName\x03\xe8\x02\x02\x02\x03's order to self-destruct.
3102	The servitors will self-destruct once approached. Either strike them from afar, or avoid them altogether.
3103	All rise for her royal highness! When angered, the queen will order her remaining subjects to self-destruct. Do not get caught in the blast.
3104	The servitors will not hesitate to self-destruct. Steel your defenses!
3105	Bomb chars are just as quick to burst as the servitors. Fall back!
3106	There! To the rear! The bomb chars advance!
3107	There is no end to the bomb chars. Turn your eyes elsewhere.
3108	He who slumbers is doomed to bear the blast's full force. Silence the slimes, lest you succumb to the flames.
3109	The queen's subjects number in the thousands. You cannot dispel them all!
3110	The order has been given! Scatter!
3111	That was but one baronet amongst many. He may have fallen, but another will soon rise to replace him.
3112	Good! The life spills from \x021\x10\xff\x09BNpcName\x03\xe8\x02\x02\x02\x03 with every blow!
3113	When the queen falls, her subjects will be overtaken with grief and end their lives. Take care not to join them!
3114	Do not grow over-confident. While one candle gutters, still a hundred bonfires rage.
3115	How little the queen's baronets value their own lives. In a sense, they are the perfect subjects.
3116	The queen will not step down from her throne so easily.
3117	Sound the bells! The queen is dead!
3200	All five \x021\x10\xff\x09BNpcName\x04\xe8\x02\x03\x02\x03 must be defeated simultaneously.
3201	Listen carefully if you want to live. \x02+\x16\xff\x14\x021\x10\xff\x09BNpcName\x02\xe8\x02\x02\x02\x03\x03 will not stay dead for long. Allow his dark brothers but a moment, and they'll drag the fallen back from the gates of the seventh hell.
3202	Another formation change!
3203	Make ready! The camios seek to regroup!
3204	They're forming a defensive line!
3205	A circle! The Screaming Circle!
3206	The Wall of Naught! The camios seek a new victim!
3207	The Black Cross renders a single camio invincible. Ignore him and focus your attacks on the rest!
3208	The Demon's Sword! The burden on your front line will be great. Healers, do not fail your allies!
3209	Something rises from the Pit! Do not falter!
3210	Their foul magicks protect him! Your attacks amount to naught!
3211	As long as one cannot be harmed, you will never be able to destroy the lot!
3212	One is down. Quickly! Finish the others!
3213	You see? Slaying one is of no use! You must defeat all five at once if the day is to be yours!
3214	The camio draws strength from the Demon's Sword. He will tear your front line apart!
3215	Follow the camio's eyes! Draw them away from your spell casters!
3216	Do not waste your efforts on the one who cannot be harmed!
3217	Shields up, front line!
3218	Rid the playing field of our new guest!
3219	Back to the task at hand, lads!
3220	Show them only as much mercy as they would show you! None!
3221	You've done it! They can no longer escape their dark demesne!
3300	Protect the Allagan artifacts from the quarreling gigants.
3301	Defeat the leaders to prevent the summoning of reinforcements.
3302	Hurry to the foot of the hill! The artifacts will not protect themselves!
3303	They're fighting amongst themselves! Let them bloody each other's noses before coming in to wipe up the mess!
3304	Small units approach! Keep them off the artifacts!
3305	Gigants from multiple sides! You'll need to divide your strength if the artifacts are to be saved!
3306	The gigas leader, Crius! He will summon his minions if not put to the sword!
3307	Giants to the east! Stop them before they can make the approach!
3308	Hecatoncheires to the south! Slaying them might just anger their leader onto the battlefield!

3310	Damnation! Keep the leaders away from one another! It will only serve to worsen matters!
3311	The gigants swing their weapons with reckless abandon! Draw them from the artifacts so as to prevent any collateral damage!
3312	The gigas leader flees! Now is your chance! Run the bastard through!
3313	The giant leader falls back... Something is amiss!
3314	That is not the back of a fleeing man! The hecatoncheir leads you into a trap!
3315	More gigants take the field, and will continue to do so until you have seen their leaders slain!
3316	Not a single scratch on any of the artifacts. I wouldn't believe it if I hadn't seen it with mine own eyes!
3317	All the artifacts remain! The Sons of Saint Coinach will be pleased!
3318	Two artifacts remain standing. See that they are not destroyed!
3319	A single artifact remains! You cannot allow it to be lost!
3320	The leaders have yet to take the field, but could arrive at any moment. Stay alert!
3321	Without an enemy to strike, the gigants have turned their fury on the artifacts!
