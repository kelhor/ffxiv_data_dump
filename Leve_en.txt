22	Touch and Heal	Company regulations state that all Order of the Twin Adder units must employ at least one conjurer at all times, so that he or she may attend to the wounds of any injured unit members. To see that the healers are able to endure the constant running about the position requires, the company is in constant need of basic, durable footwear and seeks local carpenters to assist in their creation.	1	860	94	2	0	2257767	0	9	5	2	0	51	51	76	0	51	80012	917650	110007	1	14	0	1	9	0	18	5	6
23	A Clogful of Camaraderie	On the night when recruits complete their basic training and are inducted into the Wood Wailers' hallowed ranks, each is given a pair of wooden clogs which symbolizes the forest's enduring support. Happily, the clogs also make admirable receptacles for the copious amounts of mead which the initiates are honor-bound to consume before the sun rises. A new batch of green recruits is scheduled to be sworn in over the next few suns, and the Lancers' Guild seeks skilled carpenters to help prepare the footwear to be presented during the ceremony.	1	720	93	2	0	2648092	0	19	5	2	0	90	90	76	0	54	80012	917651	110010	1	14	0	1	9	0	19	5	6
24	Bowing Out	While in pursuit of an escaped firestarter imp, a unit of Wood Wailers chased the changeling into a Gods' Quiver storehouse. Thus cornered, the imp unsuccessfully attempted to burn its way out of the building, and was quickly subdued\xe2\x94\x80though not before it had reduced several crates of shortbows to ashes. Conscious of their culpability, the Wood Wailers have agreed to replace all the damaged arms with new ones and are currently seeking local carpenters to assist them.	1	584	93	3	0	2648092	0	19	5	2	0	90	90	76	0	54	80012	917655	110010	1	14	0	1	9	0	18	5	6
25	Got Your Back	Ixali invaders will oft arrive to the battlefield in baskets carried by lighter-than-air balloons. This gives their archers an extreme advantage, while putting many of our men in danger of taking an arrow. When searching for a way to better protect those fighting on the ground, we found that simply having them wear a shield on their backs improves survival rates threefold. To see all of our units equipped with this potentially life-saving device, the Wood Wailers are hiring competent carpenters to craft wooden shields in bulk.	1	1770	94	3	0	2648092	0	19	5	2	0	90	90	76	0	54	80012	917656	110010	1	14	0	1	9	0	18	5	6
26	Gridania's Got Talent	The Homunculi\xe2\x94\x80a band of traveling bards known for their golden locks, honey-tongues, and flamboyant raiments\xe2\x94\x80have the maidens of Gridania swooning. Their popularity is so great, in fact, that many of the sylvan city-state's menfolk have taken up the harp with dreams of emulating the bards\xe2\x94\x80in particular, Homunculus high harpist Nolan Ninestring. Never ones to allow a business opportunity to slip through their fingers, Black Rabbit Traders are seeking skilled carpenters to prepare maple lumber for their contracted crafters, it being their intention to produce a range of attractive yet affordable harps.	1	720	94	3	0	2257767	0	9	5	2	0	51	51	76	0	51	80012	917657	110007	1	14	0	1	9	0	19	5	6

29	Spears and Sorcery	In the aftermath of the Calamity, the Wood Wailers found themselves ill equipped to solve the problems that confronted them, spears being of little benefit to the sick and wounded. At the recommendation of Stillglade Fane, many of the guild's lancers accordingly took up staves and crooks that they might wield the magicks of the conjurers and thereby help set the city-state's people back on their feet. Five years on, this practice has become official policy, each new member of the Wood Wailers now being required to learn several basic restorative spells. To aid their training, the guild requires large quantities of conjurers' arms and seeks talented carpenters to craft them.	1	3430	116	4	0	2648092	0	19	5	2	0	90	90	76	0	54	80012	917654	110010	5	14	0	1	9	0	19	5	6
30	Leaving without Leave	For every five recruits who complete their training at the Bannock, there are ten who prove unable to cope with the rigorous daily drills and abandon their brothers. As one might expect, most of these deserters fail to return the equipment issued to them, resulting in a constant shortage of spears and bows for new initiates. The Wood Wailers are seeking to purchase spare arms and will generously reward carpenters for each weapon produced and delivered.	1	2106	117	5	0	2648092	0	19	5	2	0	90	90	76	0	54	80012	917658	110010	5	14	0	1	9	0	18	5	6
31	A Sword in Hand	For many Ixal, the weapon of choice is the sword, meaning that training new Wood Wailer recruits on how to use one's spear to defend against the flurry of a short blade is crucial to ensuring their success in combat. The wooden swords used in these rigorous exercises are damaged easily, and therefore a constant supply is required to make sure that not a day of training is missed. Quick-working carpenters are sought to replenish depleted Wood Wailer supplies.	1	4044	142	5	0	2648092	0	19	5	2	0	90	90	76	0	54	80012	917659	110010	5	14	0	1	9	0	18	5	6
32	Compulsory Conjury	An edict recently passed by Stillglade Fane requiring all children between the ages of six and nine to train in the art of conjury has parents scrambling to find reasonably priced canes and crooks. To make sure they are not undersold by any second-rate foreign merchant, Black Rabbit Traders are urgently seeking carpenters willing to lend their services in the crafting of various conjurers' arms.	1	3160	116	5	0	2257767	0	9	5	2	0	51	51	76	0	51	80012	917660	110007	5	14	0	1	9	0	19	5	6
33	Citizens' Canes	The recent rise in the number of adventurers entering Gridania has caused demand for canes and crooks to increase dramatically\xe2\x94\x80so much so, in fact, that the woodworkers of the Oak Atrium cannot craft enough to replenish the stocks of the local weaponry shops. To help bear this burden, Black Rabbit Traders are currently seeking Disciples of the Hand with applicable skills.	1	5132	142	6	0	2257767	0	9	5	2	0	51	51	76	0	51	80012	917523	110007	10	14	0	1	9	0	18	5	6
34	On the Move	Now that many of the roads connecting the four corners of Eorzea are safe for normal passage, Disciples of the Hand from across the realm are once again bringing their talents to Gridania. And, with this many skilled crafters gathered here in the city-state, the demand for quality tools is high. To see that the demand is met, Black Rabbit Traders are seeking the help of local carpenters.	1	4460	142	6	0	2257767	0	9	5	2	0	51	51	76	0	51	80012	917524	110007	10	14	0	1	9	0	18	5	6
35	Raise the Roof	The pillars which support the stable roofs have grown old and rotten. We have repeatedly petitioned the Oak Atrium to send us lumber for use in the rebuilding effort, but equivalent projects in other locations have always been given priority, Bentbranch Meadows apparently being too remote to warrant timely assistance. As no delivery of lumber seems imminent, we have opted to petition independent carpenters to help us with our conundrum.	1	6066	239	6	0	2119045	0	5	5	2	0	94	94	76	0	54	80012	917525	110002	10	14	0	1	9	0	19	5	6
36	Say It with Spears	Were it not for the tireless efforts of the Wood Wailers, Bentbranch Meadows would be overrun with bloodthirsty beasts and unchivalrous rogues. To express our undying gratitude to the brave sentries who patrol our lands, we wish to present each one with a new spear, decorated with crow feathers found in the brush. All we require now are skilled crafters to complete the items.	1	5132	145	7	0	2119045	0	5	5	2	0	94	94	76	0	54	80012	917505	110002	10	14	0	1	9	0	18	5	6
37	Life's a Stitch	No matter how well crafted, saddles and blankets are bound to suffer wear when used day in and day out. Purchasing new equipment would prove too much of a burden on our coffers, so we have our chocobokeeps do all the necessary repairs. However, when their repair equipment is damaged, there is little the keeps can do, and that is when we turn to local carpenters to provide us with the proper tools to keep our birds happy.	1	4820	192	7	0	2119045	0	5	5	2	0	94	94	76	0	54	80012	917506	110002	10	14	0	1	9	0	18	5	6
38	Shielding Sales	Since the Conjurers' Guild reopened its doors to new recruits, prospective mages from across the realm have been flocking to Gridania, hoping to learn the ancient art of conjury and perhaps earn themselves a much-coveted place in Stillglade Fane. This has created serious demand for affordable shields, and after several moons of nigh on nonstop business, Black Rabbit Traders find their supply running dangerously low. Crafters with skill in carpentry are sought to help replenish the consortium's warehouses.	1	11616	142	7	0	2257767	0	9	5	2	0	51	51	76	0	51	80012	917507	110007	10	14	0	1	9	0	19	5	6
39	Re-crating the Scene	Several nights ago, a Wood Wailer recruit stationed in Nine Ivies for training was caught attempting to make off with a crate of spare weapons from one of the local supply tents. Under questioning, the young man revealed that he had been stealing crates since the previous fortnight and selling their contents to merchants from Ul'dah. The recruit has since been dismissed from the Wailers and exiled from the Twelveswood, but the crates he sold have not been recovered. To replace the lost items, the Wood Wailers have come to Black Rabbit Traders, and now Maisenta is seeking skilled carpenters to assist her in fulfilling the order.	1	8454	197	8	0	2257767	0	9	5	2	0	51	51	76	0	51	80012	917526	110007	15	14	0	1	9	0	18	5	6
40	Nightmare on My Street	A rumor that the popular \xe2\x80\x9cCure\xe2\x80\x9d spell can help to calm children experiencing nightmares has prompted parents across the city-state to dabble in the arts of conjury. This, in turn, has increased the demand for quality conjury arms. To ensure their supply will not run dry, Black Rabbit Traders seek the talents of skilled woodworkers.	1	8764	196	8	0	2257767	0	9	5	2	0	51	51	76	0	51	80012	917527	110007	15	14	0	1	9	0	18	5	6
41	Driving up the Wall	Recent small-scale skirmishes with Ixali warriors have given the Wood Wailers stationed at the newly constructed Josselin's Spire cause to worry that the current walls would not withstand a full-blown attack. Hoping to render the tower resistant to battering rams and other siege weaponry, the Wailers have decided to clad the walls with hundreds of extra planks. Vivandier Ayled the Steadfast will handsomely reward any able Disciples of the Hand willing to assist her in this endeavor.	1	12172	292	8	0	2255476	0	7	5	2	0	107	107	76	0	55	80012	917528	110004	15	14	0	1	9	0	19	5	6
42	Nothing to Hide	The Wood Wailers are currently conducting training exercises for new recruits, and require a fresh supply of masks to replace those damaged during their rigorous drills. Ayled the Steadfast is commissioning willing and able carpenters to create the requisite items and deliver them to her.	1	12218	200	9	0	2255476	0	7	5	2	0	107	107	76	0	55	80012	917511	110004	15	14	0	1	9	0	18	5	6
43	What You Need	In the past fortnight, gladiators from Ul'dah seeking to purchase high-quality shields have had to be turned away from Ayled the Steadfast's tents for lack of inventory. If news of her not being able to accommodate her patrons were to spread, it may result in prospective buyers taking their custom elsewhere. To prevent this, the independent vivandier is looking to purchase a significant quantity of shields and will pay top gil for each one.	1	7744	142	9	0	2255476	0	7	5	2	0	107	107	76	0	55	80012	917512	110004	15	14	0	1	9	0	18	5	6
44	Bowing to Necessity	To improve Gridania's capacity to respond swiftly to both internal and external threats, the Gods' Quiver has ordered that sentries be stationed in strategic locations throughout the Twelveswood. Before the archers can take up their posts, however, they require new bows to replace those recently stolen in a raid by a band of delinquent sylphs. Black Rabbit Traders seek skilled carpenters to craft the requested items.	1	11616	145	9	0	2257767	0	9	5	2	0	51	51	76	0	51	80012	917513	110007	15	14	0	1	9	0	19	5	6
45	As the Worm Turns	To replace a cache of worm-eaten canes and staves, Stillglade Fane is petitioning adventurers with training in carpentry to craft new arms, offering a sizable sum of gil for each complete delivery.	1	12746	239	10	0	2257767	0	9	5	2	0	51	51	76	0	51	80012	917529	110007	20	14	0	1	9	0	18	5	6
46	Behind the Mask	Once every full moon, the Wood Wailers conduct a ceremony in which they create a giant pyre and set alight wooden masks to honor the spirits of those spears who fell at the Battle of Carteneau, five summers past. Black Rabbit Traders have been commissioned to provide the masks, and they now seek talented woodworkers to assist them in completing the order in time.	1	7331	444	10	0	2257767	0	9	5	2	0	51	51	76	0	51	80012	917530	110007	20	14	0	1	9	0	26	5	6
47	Militia on My Mind	While the Wood Wailers have men and women stationed at almost every major outpost in the Twelveswood, they cannot be everywhere at once, so it is crucial that those people living outside the protective walls of Gridania are capable of defending themselves. Representatives from the Lancers' Guild travel the forest, offering free training programs to all interested, but require the help of carpenters to create the weapons used in the exercises.	1	18328	204	10	0	2257677	0	13	5	2	0	129	129	76	0	56	80012	917531	110006	20	14	0	1	9	0	19	5	6
48	Grinding It Out	A good sharp spear can spell the difference between life and death, so all Wood Wailers are taught early on to tend to their weapons daily. While many of those stationed in the field rely on whetstones carried in their satchels, lancers given assignments in larger outposts employ grinding wheels to give the spearheads a wickedly sharp edge. The unit stationed in Quarrymill has issued a request for the construction and delivery of these wheels, and are offering a sizable sum of gil in return.	1	13250	244	11	0	2257677	0	13	5	2	0	129	129	76	0	56	80012	917517	110006	20	14	0	1	9	0	18	5	6
49	Polearms Aplenty	Recent raids perpetrated by the Ixal have shown Quarrymill's fortifications to be insufficient for keeping the beast tribe at bay. To bolster the hamlet's defenses, the Wood Wailers have ordered that the main gates be reinforced with sharp-tipped spears, and will handsomely reward any able Disciples of the Hand willing to lend their talents in crafting the supplies needed.	1	5073	209	11	0	2257677	0	13	5	2	0	129	129	76	0	56	80012	917518	110006	20	14	0	1	9	0	26	5	6
50	Wall Not Found	The forest has become as a beach, for the Ixal roll in as regular as the tides. This gap in our perimeter wall is therefore a just cause for alarm and recrimination, even if there happens to be a fine new walnut bench under the kissing tree. Replacement wood must be found, and quickly.	1	18524	246	11	0	2257677	0	13	5	2	0	129	129	76	0	56	80012	917519	110006	20	14	0	1	9	0	18	5	6
51	Daddy's Little Girl	A wealthy patron's daughter has recently completed her basic training, prompting her family to celebrate by rewarding the young woman's entire graduating class with personally inscribed shields. Black Rabbit Traders seek carpenters to create shields decorated with a white serpent and deliver them immediately to Maisenta Hawke in New Gridania. The inscription work will be handled by a third party.	1	19770	263	12	0	2257767	0	9	5	2	0	51	51	76	0	51	80012	917673	110007	25	14	0	1	9	0	18	5	6
52	Tools for the Tools	After a long night of drinking at the local alehouse, a pair of young Wood Wailers stationed in Quarrymill stumbled into a barn and proceeded to have mock sword fights with the tools found inside, damaging several in the process. The culprits have been properly punished, but now comes the question of replacing the broken items. The Lancers' Guild is offering to pay carpenters (with gil taken from the recruits' salaries) for the crafting of several new forks which, in addition to maiming beasts, can also be used in cultivating fields.	1	31420	316	12	0	2257677	0	13	5	2	0	129	129	76	0	56	80012	917674	110019	25	14	0	1	9	0	19	5	6
53	Armoires of the Rich and Famous	Furnishings made of high-quality walnut have grown quite popular amongst the rich merchants refurbishing their post-Calamity residences\xe2\x94\x80so popular, in fact, that the Carpenters' Guild cannot keep up with the demand. Black Rabbit Traders believe this is the perfect opportunity for them to strengthen their foothold in the sultanate, and seek independent carpenters to help them create a sufficient quantity of walnut lumber to do so.	1	11115	465	12	0	2257767	0	9	5	2	0	51	51	76	0	51	80012	917675	110007	25	14	0	1	9	0	26	5	6
54	Storm of Swords	For many Ixal, the weapon of choice is the sword. This means that training the Gridanian smallfolk on how to best defend against the flurry of a short blade is crucial to ensuring their survival should they become the victims of a surprise attack. The wooden swords used in these rigorous exercises are damaged easily, and therefore a constant supply is required to make sure that not a day of training is missed. Quick-working carpenters are sought to replenish depleted Wood Wailer supplies.	1	22066	245	13	0	2257677	0	13	5	2	0	129	129	76	0	56	80012	917676	110019	25	14	0	1	9	0	18	5	6
55	Toys of Summer	A \xe2\x80\x9ccicada\xe2\x80\x9d is what some in the hamlets call a Wood Wailer's lance, for it is years in the wielding yet moments in the breaking; daily a lance shatters in battle, filling the woods with its fleeting song. For every lance that breaks, a new one must be fashioned\xe2\x94\x80for Gridania, and the elementals!	1	29450	323	13	0	2257677	0	13	5	2	0	129	129	76	0	56	80012	917677	110019	25	14	0	1	9	0	18	5	6
56	Heal Away	As important as it is for the residents of hamlets such as Quarrymill and Hyrstmill to be trained in the arts of war should they be attacked by the Ixal, it is just as important that they have basic knowledge in the art of healing. Every moon, the Wood Wailers travel to these remote villages to conduct simple lessons on spellcasting so that the people can better prepare themselves for danger. The staves and canes used in these lessons are given to the village folk afterwards, meaning that the guild is in constant need for newly crafted conjurers' arms.	1	8505	248	13	0	2257677	0	13	5	2	0	129	129	76	0	56	80012	917678	110019	25	14	0	1	9	0	26	5	6

58	An Expected Tourney	Once every three moons, the Gods' Quiver holds a tourney for members to showcase their abilities, the champion receiving a flawless ash cavalry bow and bragging rights for a full season. The guild has placed an order for the coming tourney's bow with Black Rabbit Traders; however, the archers will not accept anything that is less than the highest of quality.

While the nature of the sorcery is unknown, the order is eager to preserve the wisdom of the past, using staves of your crafting.	1	33921	802	240	0	4258823	0	124	5	3	0	416	416	76	0	67	80013	917702	110064	45	14	0	1	9	0	26	5	6
81	Red in the Head	Since the fall of Dalamud, the Twelveswood has seen considerably more days of sunshine than formerly, which would ordinarily be cause for celebration. Not everyone is smiling, however. In fact, the Matron's Friars\xe2\x94\x80a devout brotherhood whose shaved pates make them especially susceptible to the sun's scorching rays\xe2\x94\x80have taken to wincing. Happily, an exhaustive examination of their scripture failed to yield any passage which states that they should suffer for their goddess\xe2\x94\x80in \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03this\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 manner, at least\xe2\x94\x80and they have thus placed a large order with Black Rabbit Traders for leather caps. To help meet this order, the trading company seeks leatherworkers with the relevant cap-crafting skills.	1	480	93	102	0	2257767	0	9	9	2	0	51	51	80	0	51	80012	917661	110007	1	14	0	1	13	0	18	5	6
82	Underneath It All	A local troupe of amateur actors known to regularly put on performances at Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre has requested the delivery of several scores of leather wristbands. Supposedly, the more poorly fit performers plan to wear several of them on their arms at once to create the illusion that they are actually the muscle-clad warriors that they are attempting to portray. Black Rabbit Traders will pay leatherworkers a fine premium for wristbands crafted and delivered to Maisenta Hawke in New Gridania.	1	584	93	102	0	2257767	0	9	9	2	0	51	51	80	0	51	80012	917662	110007	1	14	0	1	13	0	18	5	6
83	Sole Traders	Thirty-malm marches through the Twelveswood wear down not only the spirits of newly recruited Wood Wailers, but the soles of their boots, too. To ensure their best customers' requests for footwear are never bootless, Black Rabbit Traders are ever on the lookout for leatherworkers to assist in replenishing their stock of leather shoes, boots, and leggings.	1	876	94	102	0	2648092	0	19	9	2	0	90	90	80	0	54	80012	917663	110010	1	14	0	1	13	0	19	5	6
84	Packmen	Though the spear may appear a Wood Wailer's best friend, defending the Twelveswood from the dangers that lurk within is not a task that can be accomplished with polearm alone. A wise soldier will always keep an ample supply of potions, herbs, rations, and other aids to survival close at hand, necessitating the use of a good belt. To ensure their men and women are properly prepared in the event of an emergency, the quartermasters of the Lancers' Guild are always on the lookout for quality belts, and skilled leatherworkers to make them.	1	728	94	103	0	2648092	0	19	9	2	0	90	90	80	0	54	80012	917667	110010	1	14	0	1	13	0	18	5	6
85	Sticking Their Necks Out	Despite their obvious lack of wit, the Ixal are smart enough to know that a blade through a man's throat will almost certainly spell his doom. This is why sturdy neckwear is just as important as a suit of armor or a shield. To outfit new recruits with temporary gear until they have completed their training, the Wood Wailers seek the services of skilled leatherworkers to help them restock their supply tents.	1	1770	93	103	0	2648092	0	19	9	2	0	90	90	80	0	54	80012	917668	110010	1	14	0	1	13	0	18	5	6
86	Tan Before the Ban	Rumors that Stillglade Fane may be considering a moratorium on the hunting of squirrels, antelopes, and hogs have left craftsmen across Gridania fearing a city-state-wide shortage of leather. To prepare for the worst, Black Rabbit Traders are looking to increase their stock, and are actively seeking leatherworkers who are skilled in the art of tanning.	1	720	93	103	0	2257767	0	9	9	2	0	51	51	80	0	51	80012	917669	110007	1	14	0	1	13	0	19	5	6
87	Mind over Muzzle	Since before the Calamity, farmers have constantly complained about the ravenous nightwolves that enter their pens after dusk and feast upon their stock. It is one of the Wood Wailers' duties to hunt down these fearsome beasts, fit them with temporary muzzles, and transport them to those corners of the Twelveswood where they might hunt at no loss to the city-state. In the past, expensive metal muzzles forged by Lominsan blacksmiths were imported for this purpose, but a recent experiment conducted by a young Wood Wailer recruit with a background in tanning has shown that leather wristbands can serve as a simple yet cost-effective alternative. Anticipating future orders from the Lancers' Guild, Black Rabbit Traders are looking to increase their stock of the bands and are offering good coin to any leatherworkers with the talent to craft them.	1	2274	117	104	0	2257767	0	9	9	2	0	51	51	80	0	51	80012	917664	110007	5	14	0	1	13	0	18	5	6
88	From the Sands to the Stage	Contrary to popular belief, stage acting can oft prove a grueling task, requiring a great deal of agility and stamina. In fact, many performance artists take up pugilism to condition their bodies for the rigors of their profession, and Black Rabbit Traders are who they turn to when looking to purchase new gear. To see that their stock of pugilists' arms do not diminish, Maisenta Hawke is always in the market to purchase finely crafted items synthesized by local leatherworkers.	1	2274	187	104	0	2257767	0	9	9	2	0	51	51	80	0	51	80012	917665	110007	5	14	0	1	13	0	18	5	6
89	In Their Shoes	On the eve of a scout's first foray into the wild, it is traditional for his fellow Wood Wailers to present him with a new pair of leggings blessed with holy magicks. The Lancers' Guild seeks skilled craftsmen to supply the basic garments in readiness for them to be borne to Stillglade Fane for consecration.	1	3430	117	104	0	2648092	0	19	9	2	0	90	90	80	0	54	80012	917666	110010	5	14	0	1	13	0	19	5	6
90	A Thorn in One's Hide	A recent attempt to clear away a nasty briar patch growing near the Bannock yielded a battalion's worth of scratched arms and a crateful of ruined gloves. The Wood Wailers seek leatherworkers to craft replacement hand gear\xe2\x94\x80preferably synthesized with a tougher variety of leather\xe2\x94\x80to prevent further pain.	1	2106	117	105	0	2648092	0	19	9	2	0	90	90	80	0	54	80012	917670	110010	5	14	0	1	13	0	18	5	6
91	A Place to Call Helm	A crate containing helms to be given to Wood Wailer recruits was left open and unattended for a full sennight before a quartermaster found it. Unfortunately, by that time, the helms had been transformed into a drey with over a half score of baby squirrels shivering within. After explaining to his commanding officer that he did not have the heart to put the tiny beasts down, it was agreed that the crate would be left alone, and a new order of training helms placed with the Adventurers' Guild.	1	2286	142	105	0	2648092	0	19	9	2	0	90	90	80	0	54	80012	917671	110010	5	14	0	1	13	0	18	5	6
92	Throwing Down the Gauntlet	Throughout the Sixth Astral Era, the act of dueling was outlawed in the city-states of Eorzea. However, recent pressure from the Battlecraft Society\xe2\x94\x80a union of guilds associated with the Disciplines of War\xe2\x94\x80has prompted city-state leaders to debate decriminalizing the practice. If the motion is agreed upon, every man and woman in Eorzea will soon be looking to lock swords with the next, and gloves will be flying left and right\xe2\x94\x80meaning that hand garments will be in high demand. To make sure that their inventory can handle a sudden rush of orders, Black Rabbit Traders are desperately seeking skilled leatherworkers to craft inexpensive sets of gloves.	1	1290	117	105	0	2257767	0	9	9	2	0	51	51	80	0	51	80012	917672	110007	5	14	0	1	13	0	19	5	6
93	Quelling Bloody Rumors	Rumors that the quartermasters of the Gods' Quiver equip new recruits with the bloody shoes of fallen scouts have made the highly superstitious people of Gridania wary of enlisting. Though these rumors could not be further from the truth, it has been decided that all initiates shall henceforth be given brand-new footwear, and several skilled leatherworkers are required to cobble the items. Those interested should report to Black Rabbit Traders representative Maisenta Hawke with the finished order.	1	4460	143	106	0	2257767	0	9	9	2	0	51	51	80	0	51	80012	917532	110007	10	14	0	1	13	0	18	5	6
94	The Bards' Guards	The Homunculi\xe2\x94\x80a band of traveling bards known for their golden locks, honey-tongues, and flamboyant raiments\xe2\x94\x80have the maidens of Gridania swooning. Their popularity is so great, in fact, that many of their most fanatical followers have taken to wearing garments which recreate the bards' unique style\xe2\x94\x80one of the most sought after being a wristguard sported by Homunculus high harpist Nolan Ninestring. Never ones to allow a business opportunity to slip through their fingers, Black Rabbit Traders are seeking skilled leatherworkers to take up their knives and help create replicas before the bards pack up their instruments and move on to the next city-state.	1	4044	142	106	0	2257767	0	9	9	2	0	51	51	80	0	51	80012	917533	110007	10	14	0	1	13	0	18	5	6
95	Saddle Sore	After a few hundred trips between the Twelveswood and Ul'dah, even the toughest leather saddles will begin to show signs of wear. New saddles, however, are costly and require several moons to break in, meaning that repair is often the more viable solution. To ensure that gear can be mended in timely fashion, we at Moogle's Gift Mounts always keep a large quantity of quality hard leather on hand, and regularly seek Disciples of the Hand trained in the skills of tanning and tawing to help us replenish our stocks.	1	3430	142	106	0	2119045	0	5	9	2	0	94	94	80	0	54	80012	917534	110002	10	14	0	1	13	0	19	5	6

98	Belt Up	The Twelveswood has begun to resound with the clamor of wildlife once more, and so the Seedseers have relaxed the restrictions placed on hunting in the immediate aftermath of the Calamity. As a result, orders for hunter's belts have increased tenfold, putting a strain on Black Rabbit Traders' limited inventory. To meet the increased demand, the consortium is hiring able-bodied leatherworkers to craft new belts from the materials stored in their warehouses.	1	7698	142	107	0	2257767	0	9	9	2	0	51	51	80	0	51	80012	917510	110007	10	14	0	1	13	0	19	5	6

100	Heads Up	To effectively protect their heads from pinecones, acorns, and other falling flora without compromising their field of vision, botanists from around the Twelveswood will often don thick leather skullcaps before setting off to reap the Twelveswood's bounty. As Gridania's premier suppliers of affordable headwear, Black Rabbit Traders would like to increase their stock of skullcaps, and will pay good coin to leatherworkers willing to craft the item in bulk.	1	8454	145	108	0	2257767	0	9	9	2	0	51	51	80	0	51	80012	917536	110007	15	14	0	1	13	0	18	5	6
101	Skin off Their Backs	From blankets to bodkins, tarpaulins to tabards, aldgoat leather can be used to make almost anything\xe2\x94\x80which is why it is constantly in high demand.

Due to their rigorous nature, these exercises can make a tattered mess of even the sturdiest garments in a matter of moons, necessitating a steady supply of replacements.

105	Playing the Part	Ever in pursuit of realism, the members of a local opera house have chosen, for their coming performance, to reenact the legendary Battle of Carteneau in full armor.

That, however, does not make them any less important, or in some cases, dangerous. One example is the eradication of hornet nests, which involves digging the massive constructions from hillsides...all while being assailed by an army of deadly vilekin. It is times like these that expertly crafted gear, especially gloves, can make the job that much safer and easier.

As a result, aldgoat leather is in short supply, as are items crafted from the material. Goatskin targes being one of Black Rabbit Traders' best sellers, consignor Maisenta Hawke must find a way to keep her stock intact, and therefore has turned to local leatherworkers for assistance.	1	23144	264	112	0	2257767	0	9	9	2	0	51	51	80	0	51	80012	917703	110007	25	14	0	1	13	0	18	5	6

Oh, if I could see the look on that rat Wynstin Walder's face when he finds out I stole the contract right out from under his filthy whiskers! Ah, but it is too early to bask in the rays of victory. I must first see the order complete and seek capable leatherworkers to ensure I can have my day in the sun!	1	11862	314	273	0	2257767	0	9	9	2	0	51	51	80	0	51	80012	917711	110007	30	14	0	1	13	0	26	5	6
120	The Hand that Bleeds	In Master Gegeruju's mansion are many rooms, and each one has a fine new doorknob fashioned after a gladiator's arm. Though I am quite partial to the mace on the northwest conservatory, I must insist on gloves for all members of the household. Spikes and blades do not a good grasping surface make.	1	31882	365	115	0	3999030	0	113	9	1	0	206	206	80	0	32	80011	917712	110031	30	14	0	1	13	0	18	5	6
121	Slave to Fashion	Love has many faces, and let us just say that Master Gegeruju knows his fair share. This day has found milord in a frolicsome mood, and he requires the services of a master leatherworker to create a splendid collar. Yours is not to question why, but to tool and dye.	1	32666	469	115	0	3999030	0	113	9	1	0	206	206	80	0	32	80011	917713	110031	30	14	0	1	13	0	18	5	6
122	Subordinate Clause	One man's tax is another man's gift, and Master Gegeruju believes in paying his tribute with a smile. As a symbol of the close yet supple bonds we share, the Maelstrom asks, nay, commands us to supply a generous number of leather collars. Submissions are being accepted.	1	11862	445	274	0	3999030	0	113	9	1	0	206	206	80	0	32	80011	917714	110031	30	14	0	1	13	0	26	5	6
123	The Righteous Tools for the Job	The goddess of Ishgard is cruel, as gods always seem to be, and demands much cruelty in turn from Her followers. Wielding their magicked ringbands and black hoods, the Holy See hunts unbelievers as Gridanians hunt the fox: the unspeakable in pursuit of the indelible.	1	61552	380	116	0	3643002	0	122	9	2	0	385	385	80	0	63	80012	917715	110062	35	14	0	1	13	0	19	5	6
124	Soft Shoe Shuffle	Black Rabbit Traders are nothing but patriotic, as I'm sure you are. The commercial life of the realm needs a little run on luxury to keep small purses from becoming overfull. We'll start with a rage for peisteskin shoes. Will you deliver the goods? For Gridania and all that, you know.	1	43194	339	116	0	2257767	0	9	9	2	0	51	51	80	0	51	80012	917716	110007	35	14	0	1	13	0	18	5	6
125	Supply Side Logic	With the Order of the Twin Adder recruiting so heavily, the Leatherworkers' Guild is busier than an assassin at an Ishgardian wedding. In fact, they're about to run out of boars' hide, and the sots who oversee their storehouses haven't a clue. When the panic comes, we shall be waiting with a ready supply.	1	19130	433	275	0	2257767	0	9	9	2	0	51	51	80	0	51	80012	917717	110007	35	14	0	1	13	0	26	5	6
126	Springtime for Coerthas	How curious, an order of leather harnesses from House Fortemps. I've not stocked them, or any other summer equipage since\xe2\x94\x80well, since the Calamity. Could it be that some in the High Houses know what we do not\xe2\x94\x80that Coerthas will be freed of this infernal cold, and soon?	1	42114	408	117	0	3643002	0	122	9	2	0	385	385	80	0	63	80012	917718	110062	35	14	0	1	13	0	18	5	6
127	Through a Glass Brightly	The First Dicasterial Observatorium of Aetherial and Astrological Phenomena has taken delivery of a new lens, and the stargazers are all as giddy as a bridegroom over the fine, cloudless glass. However, they are martyrs to frozen hands, nights being their preferred gazing time. Fingerless gloves will keep them unencumbered whilst alleviating suffering.	1	43194	551	117	0	3643002	0	122	9	2	0	385	385	80	0	63	80012	917719	110062	35	14	0	1	13	0	18	5	6
128	First They Came for the Heretics	The special inquisitors' office of the Holy See of Ishgard orders a quantity of leather collars, with the stipulation that they be \xe2\x80\x9cman-sized, of hardened leather, double sewn with no padding.\xe2\x80\x9d I could not say no. It has already been paid for, you see.	1	19600	339	276	0	3643002	0	122	9	2	0	385	385	80	0	63	80012	917720	110062	35	14	0	1	13	0	26	5	6
129	The Birdmen of Ishgard	They say it is better to be a chocobokeep for House Durendaire than a captain for House Fortemps, in such high esteem does the former hold the skill with the noble bird. Even the stable garb is of prime boarskin, proof against waspish pecks, yet with a fine wool-like hand.	1	81322	531	118	0	3643494	0	123	9	2	0	402	402	80	0	63	80012	917721	110063	40	14	0	1	13	0	19	5	6
130	Skirt Chaser	Always, the youth of the cities copy the stylings of adventurers and corsairs. Were you aware that Black Rabbit Traders employ scouts, sartorialists if you will, to study the adventurers' garb? I received a note from one such not an hour ago: \xe2\x80\x9csimple boarskin skirt.\xe2\x80\x9d Hop to it, please.	1	54994	398	118	0	2257767	0	9	9	2	0	51	51	80	0	51	80012	917722	110007	40	14	0	1	13	0	18	5	6
131	The Tao of Rabbits	True to our name, Black Rabbit Traders are ever ready to jump. The sultry weather and the fever for gladiatorial style have menfolk walking the streets in leather harnesses. Let other traders balk at chasing ignominious fads; we leap, we eat, and very well we sleep. 	1	25269	537	277	0	2257767	0	9	9	2	0	51	51	80	0	51	80012	917723	110007	40	14	0	1	13	0	26	5	6
132	Foot Blues	The wax and wane of fashion leaves the moccasin unchanged, for feet prefer warmth above all things in winter. Yet this paragon of footwear needs frequent replacing, prone as it is to a certain...manginess. The wearers' bane is a vendor's blessing; we shall move plenty of stock this winter.	1	54994	432	119	0	3643494	0	123	9	2	0	402	402	80	0	63	80012	917724	110063	40	14	0	1	13	0	18	5	6
133	Not So Alike in Dignity	Ah, the fortunate chocobokeeps of House Durendaire! Now their doting masters call for jerkins painstakingly tailored from boarskin. In other houses, only stewards are given such consideration\xe2\x94\x80except at House Fortemps, where the steward's only privilege is an extra bowl of yams at supper. 	1	55774	537	119	0	3643494	0	123	9	2	0	402	402	80	0	63	80012	917725	110063	40	14	0	1	13	0	18	5	6
134	It's Not a Job, It's a Calling	None would accuse the chocobokeeps of House Durendaire of even a moment's lapse in devotion to their charges. No dragoon is permitted to fit a new saddle without a keeper present, and it is the chocobokeep's duty to order the fine peiste saddles for the exceptional birds of House Durendaire.	1	25917	400	278	0	3643494	0	123	9	2	0	402	402	80	0	63	80012	917726	110063	40	14	0	1	13	0	26	5	6
135	Hang in There	The naturalists at Saint Coinach's Find have had a challenging fortnight at the Silvertear Falls dig, none more so than the senior naturalist. While the question of what to get a man who has tenure is a difficult one, members of the expedition are certain that he would welcome a fine belt to hold up his trews.	1	97716	576	120	0	4258823	0	124	9	2	0	416	416	80	0	67	80012	917727	110064	45	14	0	1	13	0	19	5	6
136	Too Hot to Handle 	Every misfortune is an opportunity, particularly if the misfortune be someone else's. It seems that those popular salamander hide cuffs have some horrible defect. Excellent! We'll flood the market with raptorskin bracelets. Hm? Oh, apparently, salamander skin bursts into flames without warning.	1	67146	472	120	0	2257767	0	9	9	2	0	51	51	80	0	51	80012	917728	110007	45	14	0	1	13	0	18	5	6
137	Handle with Care	One guild makes a replica weapon, and suddenly all and sundry are doing the same. The Gladiators' Guild is paying handsomely for a quantity of peiste cesti\xe2\x94\x80no stinting on material there\xe2\x94\x80to be sold as official replicas of the Oathbreakers. No second-rate work!

138	Fuss in Boots	Two of our naturalists complained of numb patches on their thighs, and the surgeon diagnosed frostnip despite the balmy weather. We believe that the dig sometimes disturbs ancient pockets of frozen air and aether, and these we must guard against lest it be frostbite next time.	1	69104	545	121	0	4258823	0	124	9	3	0	416	416	80	0	67	80013	917730	110064	45	14	0	1	13	0	18	5	6
139	Tenderfoot Moments	Knowledge once lost is oft rediscovered through the tireless work of the Sons of Saint Coinach. In one such triumph, a team at Silvertear Falls unearthed a stela bearing a cure for the common callus. Their tender feet can wear naught but the softest moccasin for some moons, but 'tis a small price to pay.	1	69104	424	121	0	4258823	0	124	9	3	0	416	416	80	0	67	80013	917731	110064	45	14	0	1	13	0	18	5	6
140	Spelling Me Softly	The past casts a long shadow, and the Sons of Saint Coinach are ever ready to live with the consequences of their actions. A recent experiment with an ancient spell has rendered all leather at a dig site a pulpous mess. We at the Find seek a quantity of raptor leather to resupply the dig.	1	33921	467	280	0	4258823	0	124	9	3	0	416	416	80	0	67	80013	917732	110064	45	14	0	1	13	0	26	5	6
141	Proly Hatchet	Gridania's high market day for hand tools draws close, and we at the Brugaire Consortium are still short some 70,000 tonzes of metal.

142	Hells Bells	The recent salt storm caused an outbreak of bronze disease, destroying virtually every bell too large to be moved indoors.

163	Honest Ballast	Captain H'rhanbolo, as notorious among landlubbers as she is glorious to the seafaring, finds her ship's holds nearly empty after a particularly lucky run. The captain sees the wisdom of having additional cargo when they sail to Ul'dah, and seeks skilled artisans to craft leatherworking tools.	1	9044	196	29	0	3999018	0	117	6	1	0	223	223	77	0	33	80011	917587	110033	15	14	0	1	10	0	18	5	6
164	Tools of the Trade	I have certain friends\xe2\x94\x80well, admirers\xe2\x94\x80who send me chatty missives about their rather dreary lives in Mor Dhona. It seems some parties have been quite at pains to tame the metal from the airship wrecks. Wears out tools in a matter of weeks, they say.

165	Unseamly Conditions	The mineral seams of Ul'dah are as hard as the cartel's grip on their riches; the tools wear out ere a replacement can be ordered. The Brugaire Consortium has a contract to establish a tool depot near the mines, and is hiring skilled Disciples of the Hand to produce the wares.	1	12218	243	30	0	4143334	0	114	6	1	0	27	27	77	0	27	80011	917541	110034	20	14	0	1	10	0	18	5	6
166	Claw Daddy	Patriarch's Day is nigh, and the Carpenters' Guild is expecting a record crowd for the Nailhead Dance. The demand for claw hammers is sure to outstrip the guild's supply, and all agree that it would be gauche to run out. Top gil is being offered for quality tools for this festivity.	1	7331	443	30	0	4143334	0	114	6	1	0	27	27	77	0	27	80011	917542	110034	20	14	0	1	10	0	26	5	6
167	Hearth Maul	Through a series of regrettable incidents, we have learned that a Wailer cannot live on battle alone. Among the improvements we are making to our encampment is a stone roasting pit around which we may share copious amounts of mead.

168	Powderpost Derby	With the plague of powder-post worms drawing ever closer to Quarrymill, the Wood Wailers have coated every post, stock, and handle with linseed and tar. Yet there will be no stopping some of the accursed wood-eaters.

169	The Devil's Workshop	A spear in one hand still leaves a hand free, and some of those posted at Quarrymill grow too restive for their own good.

170	When Rhalgr Met Nophica	With the influx of refugees from Ala Mhigo, the meteor pays court to the spring leaf and the streets of Quarrymill ring with Highland voices.

171	Time to Upgrade	The Brugaire Consortium is what it is today because of its foresight. The affordable metalworking tools offered to novices last year should be on their last leg. With the solemn one-year pledge of quality just lapsed, the workers have no choice but to purchase new tools, and quickly.	1	19770	320	32	0	4143334	0	114	6	1	0	27	27	77	0	27	80011	917745	110034	25	14	0	1	10	0	18	5	6
172	Mors Dagger	The captain's lady mother used to call the longsword a woman's weapon, and who would be fool enough to disagree with a woman thus armed? The Wailers would honor her memory by presenting every Quarrymiller of the fair sex with a longsword, and artisans so inclined will not find the militia ungrateful.	1	33100	280	32	0	2257677	0	13	6	1	0	129	129	77	0	56	80011	917746	110019	25	14	0	1	10	0	19	5	6
173	Cleaving the Glim	The Leatherworkers' Guild has experimented with a new brew of tan oak with stunning results. However, most round knives can gain no purchase on the leather's glassy smoothness.

174	Lancers' Creed	No Wood Wailer would think to leave the upkeep of his weapon to another. Every Wailer knows that this\xe2\x94\x80and only this\xe2\x94\x80is his spear. There are many others like it, but this one is his. Skilled Disciples of the Hand are sought to make tools with which Wailers can lavish care on their arms.	1	19770	258	33	0	2257677	0	13	6	2	0	129	129	77	0	56	80012	917748	110019	25	14	0	1	10	0	18	5	6
175	I Saw What You Did There	He who is raw in one discipline is well seasoned in another, and contrariwise. Though shaping up to be fine fighters, some in this company shall never a carpenter make, having not taken so much as a file to their sawblades for many a moon.

176	That's Some Fine Grinding	Wood Wailers have a passion for acorn flour bread, walnut paste, and other forest delicacies. Following recent tensions over the bogarting of tools, the militia has decided to issue every Wailer his own means to crush, pound, and powder. Interested blacksmiths will find the terms generous.	1	8505	315	33	0	2257677	0	13	6	2	0	129	129	77	0	56	80012	917750	110019	25	14	0	1	10	0	26	5	6
177	The Naked Blade	Ever in search of that sweet twilight where terror and bliss are one, Master Gegeruju commands a steel falchion be crafted for a very special skirmish.

183	You Spin Me Round	The astrologians of the Observatorium tether themselves together when they climb to the crow's nest, for the stars have the power to befuddle even the sense of what lies above and what below.

Brugaire is the preferred procurer for the Leatherworkers' Guild, as you know. No?

189	A Weighty Question	The master-at-arms of House Durendaire is as much a scholar as a warrior.

207	You've Got Mail	Armorers nimble of finger and simple in tastes are asked to present themselves to the offices of the Brugaire Consortium, where they will hear opportunities to their advantage regarding the supplying of haubergeons to be sold in Gridania.	1	2106	120	44	0	4143334	0	114	7	1	0	27	27	78	0	27	80011	917763	110034	5	14	0	1	11	0	18	5	6
208	Headbangers' Thrall	The Marauders' Guild has a list of occupational hazards as long as a blackthorn, and it is a sign of the respect they command that none dare jest about their barber bill. A split head is a hurt too far for even the marauders, and they seek delivery of barbuts to use in their fabled drills.	1	4044	142	44	0	4143334	0	114	7	1	0	27	27	78	0	27	80011	917764	110034	5	14	0	1	11	0	18	5	6
209	Bronzed and Burnt	Cooking pots seemed to work well enough as helms, but the hands all have scorched noses from the sun. The sight of so many scabrous snouts grows intolerable, for these folk were never what you'd call fair to look upon. Make us some bronze sallets before I have another snootful of scarlet.	1	3430	142	44	0	3998970	0	115	7	1	0	200	200	78	0	31	80011	917765	110030	5	14	0	1	11	0	19	5	6
210	Rodents of Unusual Size	We haven't taken care of the hayricks as well as we should have, what with all this arming instead of farming. The rats are as big as cats in some of those ricks, and a rat bite is no jest. What we need are well-made sollerets to shield the feet and deliver a hard kick with. 	1	2274	120	45	0	3998970	0	115	7	1	0	200	200	78	0	31	80011	917766	110030	5	14	0	1	11	0	18	5	6

But ye know, the Red Rooster Stead's front gate is naught more than a few deals on a pair of uprights. We need a smith to craft us a shield large enough to make fast to the gates, or the kobolds will gambol right in.	1	4044	144	45	0	3998970	0	115	7	1	0	200	200	78	0	31	80011	917767	110030	5	14	0	1	11	0	18	5	6
212	Get into Their Heads	You have a certain rapport with zealot types, do you? Excellent, excellent. They say the dragoons of Ishgard have developed an irrational dislike of steel helms. That, my footloose friend, is opportunity.

213	Waist Not, Want Not	The Holy See of Ishgard has placed an order for a belt of bronze plates, stating that the metal is most pleasing to the chocobos. There are also reports that the dragoons cook rustic viands on the sun-seared plates, when home is far and the archbishop's commands weigh heavy on their souls.	1	4460	146	46	0	4143334	0	114	7	1	0	27	27	78	0	27	80011	917589	110034	10	14	0	1	11	0	18	5	6

215	Greavous Losses	You win some, you lose some, if you get my drift and meander. Sometimes, you hedge a risk and get thrown over the hedge into the drink.

217	Still the Best	Now, I've been known to say that only the best, the second best, and the third best will do. I'm a man of conviction and you'll hear no apologies on that score. But for a thing like an alembic, only Lominsan workmanship will do. I'll not have sour grog or burnt hands on my conscience.	1	7744	268	47	0	4169749	0	116	7	1	0	218	218	78	0	33	80011	917596	110032	10	14	0	1	11	0	18	5	6

219	Cover Girl	The tedious diffidence that plagues many souls in the spring of their life has spawned a curious new fashion: youths strut the streets in a full barbut.

220	Fashion Weak	Vanity is ever a friend to commerce. Armor lasts a hundred seasons, but even the lowliest conscript lusts for the latest fashion: immodest cloisonn\xc3\xa9, a bevy of embossed beasts, novel severity.

As evidenced by a fresh slew of buried arrowheads on the deck, the crew has a need of compact round shields for the journey out.	1	8454	216	49	0	3999018	0	117	7	1	0	223	223	78	0	33	80011	917598	110033	15	14	0	1	11	0	18	5	6

228	No Hand-me-downs	There is no warrior more fierce than he who bars the enemy's way into his own home. Hence, every young woman and man of the hamlets is trained and armed as a freesword by the Wood Wailers.

236	Get Shirty	The freeswords of the hamlets are as the trees of the forest: no two are too alike, and the great and small, the gross and lissome are so unalike as to beggar words and confound the quartermaster.

251	Distill and Know that I'm Right	Ah, just the person I wanted to see. You have a good deal of experience with alchemists, do you not? Well, good enough, anyway. Almost none? As I said, good enough. We would need you to secure a good number of alembics for us.

252	Metal Fatigue	A long-dead wag once noted that the words of House Durendaire ought to be \xe2\x80\x9cBetter Is What We Like,\xe2\x80\x9d and apparently, what they like at the moment is mythril. Such is their disdain for steel, found wanting against dragon breath, that they spit upon each discard as they take up arms of mythril.	1	55774	568	59	0	3643494	0	123	7	2	0	402	402	78	0	63	80012	917904	110063	40	14	0	1	11	0	18	5	6
253	Family Secrets	It has long been the custom of a certain house to taste the first new wine of the year out of an heirloom mythril helm. Alas, it was recently discovered to be a plated copy, substituted for the original sometime during the last five score years.

254	Employee Retention	A dragoon of House Durendaire is not so easily replaced, and is said to have finer armor than many an outlander general.

255	Feasting the Night Away	The quest for knowledge is ever fraught with danger, and the last few months at Silvertear Falls illustrate how great are the risk and the rewards.

259	Booty Call	The Allagan site by Silvertear Lake continues to be a trove of knowledge great and small. The dig has reached an aether-rich stratum of crystals as hard as they are sharp. Though the naturalists are loath to surrender their moccasins, we at Saint Coinach's Find must insist on protective footwear. 	1	67146	611	61	0	4258823	0	124	7	3	0	416	416	78	0	67	80013	917911	110064	45	14	0	1	11	0	18	5	6
260	Dealing with the Tough Stuff	Under a crystallized stratum near Silvertear Lake, naturalists from Saint Coinach's Find have discovered wonderfully preserved ruins from the Great Allagan Empire.

261	Pork Is a Salty Food	It is cruel irony indeed that seawater gives the sailor neither fresh water for his cup nor plentiful salt for his pork barrel. The casks of water are already in the holds.

264	What a Sap	The mild winter's wreaked havoc on our sugarhouse. Less than half the usual harvest of maple syrup, and what we did get tastes like hot metal and must. It may be fit to feed to the pigs, but not to glaze the ham we make from them. There's no way around it: we'll need to buy some this year.	1	480	93	143	0	3998970	0	115	12	1	0	200	200	83	0	31	80011	917784	110030	1	14	0	1	16	0	18	5	6

269	A Real Fungi	The land around the Stead is full of wild mushrooms. None of them are exactly poison, but they put folk out of the way for a few bells, if you get my meaning. Now, we've got someone coming from the bank\xe2\x94\x80you'll not hear the reason why from me\xe2\x94\x80and we need a dish of mushies so toothsome he'll eat it all.	1	3430	116	144	0	3998970	0	115	12	1	0	200	200	83	0	31	80011	917789	110030	5	14	0	1	16	0	19	5	6
270	Putting the Squeeze On	For years, the Red Rooster Stead's had its own supply of La Noscean orange juice. Someone owed us a debt of honor. Dunno exactly, something to do with ham. Anyway, the debt's apparently repaid; we got a single crate with \xe2\x80\x9cwe're even\xe2\x80\x9d scrawled on it.

273	Keep Your Powder Dry	The bitter rivalry over all things sweet has boiled over into the streets, with a daylight assault on moderate confiseurs by radical chocolatiers.

274	Pretty Enough to Eat	The demand for ornamental carp is not what it was, and the writing is on the wall according to market augurs.

275	Go Ahead and Dig In	Sailors will drink anything, stevedores will eat anything. Mayhap it's the other way around, but you catch my drift. I've a mind to market farm-caught moles to mess halls.

278	The Bango Zango Diet	I've had it suggested to me that the foul temperament of sailors is due to a surfeit of food that grows above ground.

279	Omelette's Be Friends	A small complication has arisen around the imminent arrival of a trade delegation from Ul'dah: one of the merchants will touch no meat of any kind.

To quell any talk of ill omens, Captain H'rhanbolo has instituted a \xe2\x80\x9cno baking\xe2\x80\x9d rule on the pain of keelhaul.

As a result, their shore leaves tend to be an affair involving much hearty eating and property damage.

285	A Grape Idea	Poor wine can always find new life by banking the fire of its ferment with the juice of fruits. The wine so cooled enjoys great popularity among those indifferent to the noble vine.

288	For Crumbs' Sake	The honeyguide is a fickle creature. Last year, these birds favored the Wood Wailers; this year, they lead bears to honey-packed hives, leaving the Wailers to husband their stock of honey.

289	Picnic Panic	A particularly rigorous bout of practice has left the Wailers with stiff hands and sore fingers, hardly fit for patting and pinching of shortcrust pastry.

290	Food Fight	The Wood Wailers may have lost their best cook in a disagreement over dragon peppers.

291	Convalescence Precedes Essence	Seasickness is an inescapable ordeal for all new sailors.

294	Whirled Peas	The forest yields warm game and cool plants. While time will make cold meats out of spit-roasted venison, dishes of piping hot edible greens are a rare treat for the Wood Wailers. Tureens of pea soup would be just the thing to keep the body healthy and spirits high.	1	19770	240	153	0	2257677	0	13	12	2	0	129	129	83	0	56	80012	917796	110019	25	14	0	1	16	0	18	5	6
295	Love's Crumpets Lost	The annual Appreciation Tea for the womenfolk of the hamlets is upon us, but the kitchen has suffered a baker's block. It seems there was once tender passage betwixt one of the guests and a Wailer cook, and the memory of all the \xe2\x80\x9choney this\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccrumpet that\xe2\x80\x9d quite stops her usually adept hands.	1	22066	141	153	0	2257677	0	13	12	2	0	129	129	83	0	56	80012	917797	110019	25	14	0	1	16	0	18	5	6
296	I Love Lamprey	Tidy in the satchel and hearty in the belly, meat pies are the perfect ration for deep forest patrols. However, squirrels have been too long on the menu, and the rank and file grow restless at the monotony. Eel pies are certain to send them scampering into the green, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.	1	11115	258	153	0	2257677	0	13	12	2	0	129	129	83	0	56	80012	917798	110019	25	14	0	1	16	0	26	5	6
297	Pretty as a Picture	The likeness of Master Gegeruju in the attic is looking a touch bloated of late. Though the master himself is as youthful and angelic as ever, one must be ever vigilant. A course of well-aged balsamic vinegar should curb his appetites and bring his humours into balance. 	1	45424	289	154	0	3999030	0	113	12	1	0	206	206	83	0	32	80011	917799	110031	30	14	0	1	16	0	19	5	6
298	Bloody Good Tart, This	The result of many years of patient breeding, blood currants are off to an excellent start; many a ham, boned and boneless, has bathed in their sanguine juices. To raise the curtain on the second act for this remarkable fruit, the Consortium is commissioning tarts for the high market day.	1	31882	245	154	0	4143334	0	114	12	1	0	27	27	83	0	27	80011	917800	110034	30	14	0	1	16	0	18	5	6
299	True Grits	A pot of grits was left unstirred when a kitchen menial fainted from an excess of hunger. The lumpy result was served to unsuspecting northerners as hasty pudding, but the inn is now out of corn grits for breakfast. Top gil is being offered for bowls upon bowls of silky-smooth grits.	1	13887	159	289	0	4143334	0	114	12	1	0	27	27	83	0	27	80011	917801	110034	30	14	0	1	16	0	26	5	6
300	Gegeruju Gets Down	A true gourmand knows no boundaries, supping on high and low alike. Master Gegeruju has drawn admiring gasps and scandalized titters by declaring that he means to partake of humble cornbread. Alas, this is one gustatory journey that the kitchen staff dare not accompany him on.	1	30282	282	155	0	3999030	0	113	12	1	0	206	206	83	0	32	80011	917802	110031	30	14	0	1	16	0	18	5	6
301	Point Them with the Sticky End	Some say Master Gegeruju's genius for commerce flows from a mind untroubled by thought. If only they could see the bonny ideas that swim in that secret spring! This month, the master has ordered a ban on cutlery. A large order of tuna miq'abobs is sought by the biddable yet pragmatic household.	1	31882	445	155	0	3999030	0	113	12	1	0	206	206	83	0	32	80011	917803	110031	30	14	0	1	16	0	18	5	6
302	Sole Survivor	Having emerged from a bout of solitary reflection, the master is eager for society. Commodious as his kitchen is, it is no match for the ambit of the guest list and the ambition of the menu. The household wishes to arrange for top culinarians to provide baked soles for the f\xc3\xaate.	1	17670	264	290	0	3999030	0	113	12	1	0	206	206	83	0	32	80011	917804	110031	30	14	0	1	16	0	26	5	6
303	No More Dumpster Diving	The remoteness of the First Dicasterial Observatorium of Aetherial and Astrological Phenomena and the natural frugality of the astrologians conspire to stock the larders with stale castoffs from Ishgardian dragoons.

As an expert nose\xe2\x94\x80no man is better versed in vine and vintage, I assure you\xe2\x94\x80I cannot abide the smell of common things.	1	41034	443	156	0	4143334	0	114	12	1	0	27	27	83	0	27	80011	917914	110034	35	14	0	1	16	0	18	5	6

Delightful, the way they go on as though it were their nameday. I look forward to personally delivering these tidbits to our scampering customers.	1	19600	210	291	0	4143334	0	114	12	1	0	27	27	83	0	27	80011	917915	110034	35	14	0	1	16	0	26	5	6
306	Winter of Our Discontent	A poet once said a winter river makes urchins of us all, gazing through a frosted pane at what we cannot have. I find myself thinking strange thoughts and I know not why... You can perhaps procure a stock of carp and mugwort. Beer-steamed carp being a thing of the past, mugwort will have to do.	1	43194	359	157	0	3643002	0	122	12	2	0	385	385	83	0	63	80012	917916	110062	35	14	0	1	16	0	18	5	6
307	Rise and Dine	The food at the Observatorium is much improved, and the astrologians grow positively pink-cheeked. It gives me joy to see them prosper, so pure is their life's pursuit and so harmonious their days. I would like to present them with a triumphant cheese souffle to thank them for their custom.	1	41034	208	157	0	3643002	0	122	12	2	0	385	385	83	0	63	80012	917917	110062	35	14	0	1	16	0	18	5	6
308	Leek Soup for the Soul	The dragoons of House Durendaire are on maneuvers, and the deaths already begin to mount. Many are too fatigued to take much nourishment at the end of the day, and so succumb to cold, a fall, a thrust they may otherwise have parried. Steaming bowls of cawl cennin may make all the difference.	1	23940	359	292	0	3643002	0	122	12	2	0	385	385	83	0	63	80012	917918	110062	35	14	0	1	16	0	26	5	6
309	Moving Up in the World	With the fall of the Stone Vigil, the Whitebrim outpost finds its import much enhanced.

Commerce needs ships and ships need sailors\xe2\x94\x80gaudy wildlings known to hang their captains from the yardarm because they like not their salt pork supper. This jerked beef is tantamount to bribery, rank bribery, by the shipowner. Hmph!	1	54214	383	158	0	4143334	0	114	12	1	0	27	27	83	0	27	80011	917920	110034	40	14	0	1	16	0	18	5	6

Three units ought to do.	1	7744	237	127	0	2540087	0	120	11	3	0	271	271	82	0	42	80013	917641	110036	10	14	0	1	15	0	18	5	6
338	Unbreak My Heart	Walk softly, for the buyer of cloths is not well. Her heart has been broken by a lover most faithless, and will beat only in fits and starts. Remembering that home is where the heart is, the desolate damsel now seeks to mend the roof tiles that shelter her fragile bosom from the elements. Might I suggest a degree of haste? Her discernment for weave is not to be equaled.	1	6066	146	127	0	4067692	0	118	11	3	0	39	39	82	0	39	80013	917642	110038	10	14	0	1	15	0	19	5	6
339	Shut Up and Take My Gil	Distasteful as it is to take advantage of passing fads, it can hardly be avoided entirely. I am simply besieged with inquiries about magical arms. \xe2\x80\x9cMy shop fills with adventurers, my shelves empty of crooks and staves,\xe2\x80\x9d is what my old friend tells me.

340	Book and a Hard Place	As a long-standing purveyor of highly dangerous books, my heart breaks to see grimoires begrimed and battered. The broken spines and tea stains I have seen! I hope to offer tomes bound in water-hardened leather with fine engravings, if the terms prove agreeable to my artisan colleagues. 	1	12218	390	128	0	4067692	0	118	11	3	0	39	39	82	0	39	80013	917644	110038	15	14	0	1	15	0	18	5	6
341	Kiss of Life	They say that it always rains at night in the lichyard of the Church of Saint Adama Landama, so swollen is the air with tears greedily suckled from careworn cheeks by day. It is one of the duties of the church to tend to those overcome by grief and heat, with a dose of potion of vitality.	1	13146	143	128	0	2540238	0	121	11	3	0	300	300	82	0	44	80013	917645	110037	15	14	0	1	15	0	19	5	6
342	There's Something About Bury	A Highlander on her way to the Church of Saint Adama Landama has commissioned a grimoire bound in specially tooled leather, to accompany a friend on what she calls \xe2\x80\x9cthe very last journey he will take.\xe2\x80\x9d Since it is not entirely clear whether this is euphemism or pessimism, best to assume nothing.	1	8114	195	129	0	2540238	0	121	11	3	0	300	300	82	0	44	80013	917646	110037	15	14	0	1	15	0	18	5	6
343	Sanity Points	They say that there are holes in the middle of things, as many as there are reasons that bring the living to the lichyard of Saint Adama Landama bearing their dead. It is one of the duties of the church to close grief-blasted eyes with potion of mind. Look away, lest you see the void.	1	12218	142	129	0	2540238	0	121	11	3	0	300	300	82	0	44	80013	917647	110037	15	14	0	1	15	0	18	5	6
344	Devil Take the Foremost	Ah, the Coliseum management. They have taken the recent odium over alchemical enhancements to their black hearts and propose to let combatants alter their chemistry unhindered. Pray to the Twelve these alchemical potations will not further addle those long befuddled by dreams of glory.	1	13566	145	129	0	4067692	0	118	11	3	0	39	39	82	0	39	80013	917648	110038	15	14	0	1	15	0	19	5	6
345	Everything Is Impossible	You've heard of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Egret,\xe2\x80\x9d I presume. It seems that as a magical treatise, it's proven to be other than the usual nuisance\xe2\x94\x80it's a bona fide debacle shaping up into a fine minor disaster.

346	Don't Forget to Take Your Meds	Final examinations are coming up at Frondale's Phrontistery. One can hardly sleep for all the shrieking, and the streets below the dormitories fill with a miasma of fretful sighs heavy with onions and wakefulness. At this juncture, the potion of intelligence would be a public service.	1	4869	234	130	0	4067692	0	118	11	3	0	39	39	82	0	39	80013	917566	110038	20	14	0	1	15	0	26	5	6
347	The Writing Is Not on the Wall	Soot and wine make a fine dark ink\xe2\x94\x80as easily read by foes as by friends. Those in the trade speak of many kinds of vanishing ink\xe2\x94\x80discerning ink, timorous ink, mistrustful ink, ink most misanthropic. Alchemists well versed in all these and more are sought.	1	20578	404	130	0	2257677	0	13	11	3	0	129	129	82	0	56	80013	917567	110006	20	14	0	1	15	0	19	5	6
348	Dripping with Venom	Poison dishonors only when wielded by a warrior whose skill has long outstripped the need for such petty safeguards. The first duty of a novice is to live to fight another day, and we intend to take any measures necessary to bring this about.	1	12746	234	131	0	2257677	0	13	11	2	0	129	129	82	0	56	80012	917568	110006	20	14	0	1	15	0	18	5	6
349	Blind Man's Bluff	Too much time spent in the Twelveswood can lead to \xe2\x80\x9cgreen fatigue,\xe2\x80\x9d where a warrior cannot see the trees for the forest\xe2\x94\x80or see a band of Ixal with drawn swords, for that matter.

350	Hush Little Wailer	The ranks of Wailers swell, each with dust of a different land on her boots and the lilt of a different song in her voice. If they are to become comrades in arms, they must learn a new tongue: silence. No recruit emerges from the seven nights' ordeal unchanged, such is the power of the potion.	1	13250	192	131	0	2257677	0	13	11	2	0	129	129	82	0	56	80012	917570	110006	20	14	0	1	15	0	18	5	6
351	Automata for the People	The automata maker Jhabir's would like to try crab oil for its ambitious commission: getting an aurochs down a staircase. It hardly bears mentioning that the oil must be at its most purified. The services of a fine alchemist are not always so easily secured, but I have ever found you resourceful.	1	19770	272	132	0	4067692	0	118	11	3	0	39	39	82	0	39	80013	917817	110038	25	14	0	1	15	0	18	5	6
352	Glazed and Confused	Charged with keeping the peace of the Twelveswood for the commonfolk of Gridania, the Wood Wailers must themselves be the model of law and order.

353	Sophomore Slump	Arcanists trained in Limsa have been turning up in Ul'dah in surprising numbers\xe2\x94\x80well, surprising to others but not to us, if I may say so. No longer a novice but not yet an adept\xe2\x94\x80where else would they go but to the city of gold and blood?

354	Conspicuous Conjuration	The woods have depth that the uninitiated cannot plumb. Even the most cunning Wailer would be ill-advised to venture forth without a show of mantic force, for there are ancient eyes that see insult in empty hands. Wands of conspicuous size, but well away from the verge of vulgarity, are sought.	1	20946	316	133	0	2257677	0	13	11	2	0	129	129	82	0	56	80012	917820	110019	25	14	0	1	15	0	18	5	6
355	You Put Your Left Hand In	A passing arcanist called one of the sergeants a drunken fool, and what does the man do but challenge her to a duel?

356	The Wailers' First Law of Potion	It is a poor militia whose armory is better stocked than its infirmary, for wounds are easily given and hardly healed. When even the babbling of the brook prophesies war, a stockpile of hi\x02\x1f\x01\x03potions is no precaution but a necessity\xe2\x94\x80and necessity is the mother of fair compensation.	1	11115	290	133	0	2257677	0	13	11	2	0	129	129	82	0	56	80012	917822	110019	25	14	0	1	15	0	26	5	6

But the pong of the poor shames the city that plays the miser with its soap and linen, not the poor themselves. For our part, we seek affordable yet durable undergarments as wares.	1	584	93	82	0	4067692	0	118	10	3	0	39	39	81	0	39	80013	917829	110038	1	14	0	1	14	0	18	5	6
382	Trew Enough	We urgently seek delivery of durable hempen trews for workers newly arrived in the city. With work, these displaced men, women and children may establish themselves and provide for others, but who would hire a man without pants? I believe trews are the key to the future, if I may be so bold.	1	1770	95	82	0	4067692	0	118	10	3	0	39	39	81	0	39	80013	917830	110038	1	14	0	1	14	0	18	5	6
383	Not Cool Enough	Got some northerners working the caravan route, friend. Hard people, hard workers, but the weather's been a right harder mistress. They wear their northern wool and leather, and boil. They shed 'em, and burn. You see how it is. They need something fit for our climes, or they'll be dead betimes.	1	1092	94	82	0	3958293	0	119	10	3	0	263	263	81	0	42	80013	917831	110035	1	14	0	1	14	0	19	5	6
384	Hire in the Blood 	More gloves for our haulers\xe2\x94\x80the last lot's near gone and they can't work without 'em. Why? No one likes blood, friend. See, some might not object to it much and others may like spilling it, but there's nobody likes the stuff itself. Portage mauls the hands, and we can't have red on the cargo.	1	584	93	83	0	3958293	0	119	10	3	0	263	263	81	0	42	80013	917832	110035	1	14	0	1	14	0	18	5	6
385	Burn Me Up	So many new arrivals in Thanalan, we're running out of even stock items like cowls. This one's somewhat urgent, friend. The sun's no joke in the desert, and these underclad Gridanians and Lominsans, they sure aren't laughing. I was a stranger here myself not too long ago, I know all about it.	1	1770	96	83	0	3958293	0	119	10	3	0	263	263	81	0	42	80013	917833	110035	1	14	0	1	14	0	18	5	6
386	Long Hair, Long Life	The late unlamented Master Ashgana was fond of saying, \xe2\x80\x9cUncertain times make old women of us all.\xe2\x80\x9d It appears he was correct in this one respect, for I hear droves of folk now eschew the barber's shears in some rank superstition. These tresses must be covered, ere we face a plague of lice.	1	1092	94	83	0	4067692	0	118	10	3	0	39	39	81	0	39	80013	917834	110038	1	14	0	1	14	0	19	5	6
387	The Adventurer's New Coat	With the Grand Companies reinstated, demand has soared for garments that were barely sellable before. Take tabards\xe2\x94\x80quite popular now for all the officers of arms wear them. Certainly, the emblazoned coats and swaggering airs have filled with envy every Rohm, Wik and Bari of the city.	1	2106	117	84	0	4067692	0	118	10	3	0	39	39	81	0	39	80013	917835	110038	5	14	0	1	14	0	18	5	6
388	A Taste for Dalmaticae	With its geometric yet ample lines, the dalmatica is the only garment we may rely on to appeal to women and men, the ecclesiastic and the fantastic. I suspect that the reaction against pomp and pageantry is about to set in. If my terms are agreeable, bring a shipment of plain hempen dalmaticae.	1	4044	117	84	0	4067692	0	118	10	3	0	39	39	81	0	39	80013	917836	110038	5	14	0	1	14	0	18	5	6
389	Just for Kecks	A shaft cave-in at Copperbell Mines\xe2\x94\x80bad business, that, though it could have been worse. Amajina & Sons are concerned they'll have a worker revolt on their hands over the incident, so they're taking steps to better the miners' kits, kecks and all. 	1	3430	141	84	0	3958293	0	119	10	3	0	263	263	81	0	42	80013	917837	110035	5	14	0	1	14	0	19	5	6
390	Wiggle Room	The caravan is a \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03potential\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 space, friend. There's always room if the product's good, there's always a way if a thing's got to happen. That's why so many of us in the Seventy-Seven Caravans come from quartermastering. We're sending shepherd's tunics to Limsa, and you'd better believe there's room.	1	2106	118	85	0	3958293	0	119	10	3	0	263	263	81	0	42	80013	917838	110035	5	14	0	1	14	0	18	5	6
391	This Is Why You Can't Have Nice Things	Here's something for you, friend\xe2\x94\x80a call for amateur's breeches from the Order of Nald'thal. \xe2\x80\x9cAscetic,\xe2\x80\x9d they ask for. That means it's for initiates; the Order keeps them on cabbage, chicken feet and hempen raiments, claims it teaches them the value of gil.

392	Time for Acton	An arming doublet is a harming avoided, is that not the way the ditty goes? Truly, some novice adventurers have no ears to hear with, and you shall know them by their stiff-armed walk, holding poultices in the pits of their arms. Tut, that should teach them to wear armor over unpadded flesh.	1	3430	117	85	0	4067692	0	118	10	3	0	39	39	81	0	39	80013	917840	110038	5	14	0	1	14	0	19	5	6
393	Hat in Hand	Ashgana's being a favored supplier of long standing to the Botanists' Guild, it is only natural that we occasionally make a gift of items such as\xe2\x94\x80straw hats, yes, that will do. You see, commerce would be a thing of utter dreariness without such friendship\xe2\x94\x80the human touch that gives it dignity.	1	4460	140	86	0	4067692	0	118	10	3	0	39	39	81	0	39	80013	917625	110038	10	14	0	1	14	0	18	5	6
394	Workplace Safety	Amajina & Sons are kitting out their miners with quite a surprising thoroughness. Take this order, for instance\xe2\x94\x80hempen scarf \xe2\x80\x9cfor wrapping about the mouth and face, woven exceedingly fine and doubled so as to entrap noxious dust.\xe2\x80\x9d Dear, dear, what a very different air they're dancing these days.	1	7744	240	86	0	4067692	0	118	10	3	0	39	39	81	0	39	80013	917626	110038	10	14	0	1	14	0	18	5	6
395	Keep It under Wraps	Our traders travel many a malm under the desert sun; ours are no footloose ocean voyages of Lominsan traders, no siree. This order for cotton turbans won't be going out as cargo, but right on the heads of our traders and cargadores to keep their brains from boiling out their ears.	1	7698	243	86	0	2540087	0	120	10	3	0	271	271	81	0	42	80013	917627	110036	10	14	0	1	14	0	19	5	6
396	Making Gloves Out of Nothing at All	Do you know what the difference between kitting out traders and soldiers is? A soldier's leverage is spears and swords, but a trader's could be \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03anything.\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 I can't tell you how often a trader seals the deal by throwing in the gloves off his own hands\xe2\x94\x80so much so that we always keep extras.	1	4460	143	87	0	2540087	0	120	10	3	0	271	271	81	0	42	80013	917628	110036	10	14	0	1	14	0	18	5	6
397	Welcome to the Cotton Club	We've begun dealings with a La Noscean farm, the Red Rooster Stead. Nice folk, always very happy to try new things. They seem to only have leather gauntlets over in their parts, and the heat being what it is, I'm fair certain they'd appreciate cotton halfgloves. 	1	7744	144	87	0	2540087	0	120	10	3	0	271	271	81	0	42	80013	917629	110036	10	14	0	1	14	0	18	5	6
398	Dirt Cheap	A caravan rolls soon for verdant Gridania, and shall return laden with last season's gardening hats, pungent with oils and castings of dew worms. Curious that the Gridanians accept naught but a barter for these fruits of summer, when they sell for a kingly sum to the rose growers of our fair city.	1	7698	145	87	0	4067692	0	118	10	3	0	39	39	81	0	39	80013	917630	110038	10	14	0	1	14	0	19	5	6
399	Read the Fine Print	A shipment of rustic raiments rolls for Gridania soon, and it seems there is room for one more crate due to a regrettable breach of contract. Yes, there is much to regret when trust is broken\xe2\x94\x80and dark runes must be cast by the poison moon. Dear, dear.

400	Don't Trew So Hard	I find that other southron traders abandon their evenhandedness when dealing with Gridania: too much exoticism, too low or high a price. They forget the dexter and become downright sinister. Our way is to meet them on their own terms, with something simple such as ever-practical trews.	1	12218	196	88	0	4067692	0	118	10	3	0	39	39	81	0	39	80013	917632	110038	15	14	0	1	14	0	18	5	6
401	Better Shroud than Sorry	It is said that burying the dead in a merchant's kurta ensures a better bargain in the hall of judgment. While none admit to this belief, more kurtas are sold than worn in the streets, for when it comes to the departed, it is those who love them best who nurse the most doubts about their virtue.	1	13146	244	88	0	2540238	0	121	10	3	0	300	300	81	0	44	80013	917633	110037	15	14	0	1	14	0	19	5	6
402	Pants Are Not Enough	Many a weary traveler on the overland route to Gridania takes refuge in the safety of Camp Drybone. The outpost is also something of a market town, with traders' caravans offering their wares, and the Seventy-Seven Caravans may always be relied upon for practical staples such as trews.	1	8114	191	89	0	2540238	0	121	10	3	0	300	300	81	0	44	80013	917634	110037	15	14	0	1	14	0	18	5	6
403	Touch Me If You Can	It is said that mythril, in the hands of a crafter wanting in the eyes of the Twelve, will become as spidersilk and bind his hands that he may never work any metal again. Prudence being the way of goldsmiths, the custom is for them to don gloves until such time as they feel the gods' favor upon them.	1	12218	192	89	0	2540238	0	121	10	3	0	300	300	81	0	44	80013	917635	110037	15	14	0	1	14	0	18	5	6
404	A Drag of a Doublet	Amajina & Sons writes with more than a touch of asperity; it seems the last lot of miners' doublets had sleeves down to the fingertips, and between the surfeit of warmth and the clumsiness...well. May we suggest a sleeveless approach? Mining is perilous enough without the added hazards of fashion.	1	13146	244	89	0	4067692	0	118	10	3	0	39	39	81	0	39	80013	917636	110038	15	14	0	1	14	0	19	5	6
405	Don't Sash Me	Ah, the rat race of commerce. One spends the first hundred malms being castigated for being a young know-nothing, and no sooner does that end than is one being berated as an out-of-touch fool. I feel a need to gird myself anew for battle, if I may exaggerate. I shall pay handsomely for a new sash. 	1	12746	244	90	0	4067692	0	118	10	3	0	39	39	81	0	39	80013	917559	110038	20	14	0	1	14	0	18	5	6
406	Hitting Below the Belt	My clerk tells me that the future in pants is looking quite bright. We shall divest ourselves of hose and leave things rather more open-ended.

407	Doublet Jeopardy	Outfitting the growing lads and lasses of the hamlets is no simple matter. Some of the freeswords burst their seams at the swing of the spear or a sniff of pepper; others totter in the wind like a sail of green wool with boots for a boat. Sleeveless doublets, true in fit, are urgently sought.	1	20578	290	90	0	2257677	0	13	10	3	0	129	129	81	0	56	80013	917561	110006	20	14	0	1	14	0	19	5	6
408	Getting Handsy	While each Wailer and freesword is taught to care for his own accoutrement, items as heavily used as gloves must need regular replacing.

409	The Telltale Tress	The beastmen have keen sight and may read the strength of Wailer patrols from strands of hair caught in branches overhead; who has not seen a twig twined with silk from a passing crown?

411	Piling It On	Ul'dahn velveteen can be made exceedingly fine, lending itself to ordinarily inconceivable uses. I myself have mistaken it for true velvet, so soft a hand it has. If I may expound, a good trader knows not only what he \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03is\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 trading, but what he \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03should\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 be\xe2\x94\x80in this case, velveteen blouses for Limsa.	1	19770	264	92	0	4067692	0	118	10	3	0	39	39	81	0	39	80013	917841	110038	25	14	0	1	14	0	18	5	6
412	I'll Be Your Wailer Today	The Wood Wailers wear many hats, but only in the metaphorical sense. Whatever the duty of the moment, a Wailer is garbed in her usual manner, leading to some vexation among the ranks of novice freeswords. The militia is ordering hats of distinct styles to be worn for certain duties.	1	33100	208	92	0	2257677	0	13	10	3	0	129	129	81	0	56	80013	917842	110019	25	14	0	1	14	0	19	5	6
413	He's Got Legs	The craze for velveteen creeps ever downward. First it was hats, then coats, then blouses. While I enjoy the suspense\xe2\x94\x80suspenders, mayhaps?\xe2\x94\x80of being bystanders, our coffers certainly would not.

414	Pantser Corps	Freeswords being quite youthful, it is their nature to outgrow their garb in a matter of months. While most can be easily kitted out from existing stock, the number of recruits in need of new trews strains even the able hands and ample reserve of the Wailers' quartermaster. 	1	12218	242	93	0	2257677	0	13	10	2	0	129	129	81	0	56	80012	917844	110019	25	14	0	1	14	0	18	5	6
415	Put a Lid on It	There is a belief among some of the more credulous botanists that a bareheaded greenthumb brings ill luck to the whole party.

416	Bet You Anything	As a result of a sophomoric wager involving a bramble patch and a mug of landtrap tea, there is a distinct shortage of pants in the encampment.

He speaks with such frankness about the cheeky charms of his latest inamorata that it has left some of the household quite...flustered.

424	Private Concerns	I've received a rather frantic call from an old friend. The Armorers' Guild's latest codpiece design has proven somewhat ill-fitting. He's certain that padded trews will correctly seat the offending bit of steel. This bit of laxness is quite unlike him. I shall have to keep an eye on his doings.	1	41034	409	96	0	4067692	0	118	10	3	0	39	39	81	0	39	80013	917950	110038	35	14	0	1	14	0	18	5	6
425	Crunching the Numbers	In commerce, we must rely on numbers as much as intuition. Tantamount to heresy, I know. However, I would like to point out that as I predicted, Gridanians show a marked preference for simplicity. I'll wager that this consignment of modest hats will outsell the florid nonsense.	1	23940	534	267	0	4067692	0	118	10	3	0	39	39	81	0	39	80013	917951	110038	35	14	0	1	14	0	26	5	6
426	The Wages of Sin	Unbelievers are thieves of sorts, they say, for they withhold the sweat of their brows from the crusade. What has been stolen must be given by another. These sempstress' shifts are for the wives, mothers, and sisters of unbelievers, to wear in penitence in the workhouse of the Holy See.	1	43194	477	97	0	3643002	0	122	10	2	0	385	385	81	0	63	80012	917952	110062	35	14	0	1	14	0	18	5	6
427	In over Your Head	The Calamity makes penitents of us all. The unpredictable winds and creeping chills have made cowls something of a staple item, especially in Coerthas. I have no doubt that you are equal to the task of finding a tailor practiced in the making of monastic garments, even on such short notice.	1	41034	474	97	0	3643002	0	122	10	2	0	385	385	81	0	63	80012	917953	110062	35	14	0	1	14	0	18	5	6
428	A Leg Up on the Cold	It seems that on a recent inspection of an outpost, some of the knights of Ishgard had the foresight to go girded against the cold in linen tights under their armor. They were much envied by others of their party, who are now clamoring for well-fitted hose of their own. 	1	23940	531	268	0	3643002	0	122	10	2	0	385	385	81	0	63	80012	917954	110062	35	14	0	1	14	0	26	5	6
429	Cool to Be Southern	Whitebrim Front is fast becoming a stronghold proper following the fall of the Stone Vigil, and every week, masons, chocobokeeps, cooks, and other hands enter the service. They feel the bite of the northerly climes more keenly, and the lord commander will not have the infirmary further strained.	1	83662	526	98	0	3643494	0	123	10	3	0	402	402	81	0	63	80013	917955	110063	40	14	0	1	14	0	19	5	6
430	After the Smock-down	I see that the Fraternal Order of Chocowackers is back. I told them velveteen was no material for stablehands' smocks, and they took their business elsewhere in a huff. Half a year hence they return with hat and fat purse in hand. A pleasant surprise, and one that reflects well on them.	1	54214	425	98	0	4067692	0	118	10	3	0	39	39	81	0	39	80013	917956	110038	40	14	0	1	14	0	18	5	6
431	Party Animals	The who's who of Ul'dah is at its frothiest yet this season. My scouts report that Master Gegeruju's party at his country house will feature serving staff in antlers and deerskin. When one of his rivals looks for a clever rejoinder for her own party, Ashgana's will just happen to have these hats.	1	32049	522	269	0	4067692	0	118	10	3	0	39	39	81	0	39	80013	917957	110038	40	14	0	1	14	0	26	5	6
432	I'll Swap You	Gil has quite lost its value in some parts of Coerthas, where winter is king and warmth the only coin of the realm. Bartering is the preferred method of commerce, and well-made doublets buy three times their own worth in wool grease.	1	55774	506	99	0	3643494	0	123	10	2	0	402	402	81	0	63	80012	917958	110063	40	14	0	1	14	0	18	5	6
433	No Country for Cold Men	The Temple Knights journey soon to Whitebrim. As you know, a knight of the Holy See serves for life. The dragons do an excellent job of maintaining a, shall we say, \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03rhythmic\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 turnover, but there are some in the party who have lived too long not to feel the lancing winds of the north.	1	54214	433	99	0	3643494	0	123	10	2	0	402	402	81	0	63	80012	917959	110063	40	14	0	1	14	0	18	5	6
434	A Matter of Import	The sheepfolk of Coerthas have more greed than sense. Their woolhouse is bare and coins will not keep snow off the head. Deliver a good quantity of traditional Coerthan hats\xe2\x94\x80likely they will call them warmer, woolier, and altogether preferable to what they could have made with their own hands.	1	32049	639	270	0	3643494	0	123	10	2	0	402	402	81	0	63	80012	917960	110063	40	14	0	1	14	0	26	5	6
435	Full Moon Fever	As we speak, naturalists of Saint Coinach's Find toil in a dig site by Silvertear Lake. Their hardship has been great, and there are malign influences at work that would convert them to strange and off-putting ways. Already there are signs that\xe2\x94\x80no matter, new trews will put everything to rights.	1	103656	595	100	0	4258823	0	124	10	3	0	416	416	81	0	67	80013	917961	110064	45	14	0	1	14	0	19	5	6
436	Glad As a Hatter	Stillglade Fane sends word that its sanctioned hatmaker has succumbed to hatters' shakes. The poor soul had yet to complete his work on summer headwear for the brothers. We shall have to take up his hat block\xe2\x94\x80though not the quicksilver.	1	67146	628	100	0	4067692	0	118	10	3	0	39	39	81	0	39	80013	917962	110038	45	14	0	1	14	0	18	5	6
437	Seeing It Through to the End	The jeweler Babawai is replacing his scullions' smocks after more years than\xe2\x94\x80well, than some can count. I understand he uses the same test for his puff pastry and household linen: it's done when one can read a letter through it.	1	39087	710	271	0	4067692	0	118	10	3	0	39	39	81	0	39	80013	917963	110038	45	14	0	1	14	0	26	5	6
438	Big in Mor Dhona	Unaccustomed to hearty portions and roisterous company, not a few naturalists have found their girth expanding on the shores of Silvertear Lake. The cook blushes, the surgeon shrugs, and the sempster seethes. The Sons will no doubt grow lean again, but until then, some new tunics must be stocked.	1	69104	615	101	0	4258823	0	124	10	3	0	416	416	81	0	67	80013	917964	110064	45	14	0	1	14	0	18	5	6
439	And a Haircut Wouldn't Hurt	Without wishing to be unkind, those immersed in the quest for knowledge oft disregard the need for the other kind of immersion\xe2\x94\x80in hot water and soap. The naturalists' robes are badly in need of replacing. Sew new ones, so we may cast the reeking rags in a fire with the heat of a hundred suns.	1	67146	685	101	0	4258823	0	124	10	3	0	416	416	81	0	67	80013	917965	110064	45	14	0	1	14	0	18	5	6
440	Bundle Up, It's Odd out There	The dig at Silvertear Falls advances daily, and it warms the hearts of all and sundry at Saint Coinach's Find to see what marvels our naturalists have uncovered. Yet a fit of catarrh or dumb chill may bring this whole endeavor to a halt. Warmer garb they must have, starting with their heads.	1	39087	673	272	0	4258823	0	124	10	3	0	416	416	81	0	67	80013	917966	110064	45	14	0	1	14	0	26	5	6
441	Copper and Robbers	We have something of an urgent call for copper ingots. A check of the inventories found a slight discrepancy, the author of which is being traced by a discreet inquiry. In my grandsire's days, the wretch would have lost a hand, but these days... But there is naught to be gained from nostalgia.	1	480	94	62	0	4067692	0	118	8	3	0	39	39	79	0	39	80013	917853	110038	1	14	0	1	12	0	18	5	6
442	Needful Rings	Well-worked copper jewelry brings much delight when silver and gold are out of reach. We are nothing but democratic at Ashgana Exports; offer something for everyone, seek not to be everything for someone. One road leads to riches and happiness, the other to the vale of tears.	1	1770	97	62	0	4067692	0	118	8	3	0	39	39	79	0	39	80013	917854	110038	1	14	0	1	12	0	18	5	6
443	Arms for the Poor	Thaumaturges and bait worms, I've fear o' both. Now, thaumaturges, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em\xe2\x94\x80and many do, many do! But how many of those gaunt hopefuls in the line can afford the contrivances, you figure? A rich guild it is, friend, but there's many who'd be grateful for cut-rate arms.	1	1092	93	62	0	3958293	0	119	8	3	0	263	263	79	0	42	80013	917855	110035	1	14	0	1	12	0	19	5	6
444	Hora at Me	Ever done any arena fighting, friend? Nothing to be ashamed of, though some look askance at it. You know how it is\xe2\x94\x80if you've got something, you either sell it on your own terms or someone does it for you. The Coliseum doesn't lack for hopefuls, but they'll need at least a pair of hora to try out.	1	584	93	63	0	3958293	0	119	8	3	0	263	263	79	0	42	80013	917856	110035	1	14	0	1	12	0	18	5	6
445	Bad Bromance	This one's a personal order, friend. A pal of mine was in that lading accident at Scorpion Crossing. To be more precise, he \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03caused\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 the accident\xe2\x94\x80always was clumsy, and enjoys a tipple. Anyway, he wants a walking stick, my money's no object.

446	Water of Life	You are too young to know it, but time was every manse had a copper basin of water for passersby. Copper sweetens water\xe2\x94\x80I think of that whenever I see the Ala Mhigans drinking from the public fount. They hold the water in their mouth awhile, along with a ring of copper on a bit of chain.	1	1290	93	63	0	4067692	0	118	8	3	0	39	39	79	0	39	80013	917858	110038	1	14	0	1	12	0	19	5	6
447	Gods of Small Things	In times such as these, the best of the commonfolk seek comfort in small things, and the worst in ways outsized and gross. There is always much to gain from serving the former, for they are the heart of this world. There is comfort in a thing well-made, even in the copper baubles you are to deliver.	1	2106	116	64	0	4067692	0	118	8	3	0	39	39	79	0	39	80013	917859	110038	5	14	0	1	12	0	18	5	6
448	I Ram What I Ram	Ashgana's has been contracted by the Coliseum management to supply ramhorn claws. They will apparently be used in a series of novelty fights between gladiators and rams.

450	A Ringing Success	I've a pal just set up at the Ebony Stalls in Gridania and there's a caravan headed out that way ere too long. The last lot of copper rings he bought from us sold so well that he's in panic to get a hold of more. Stock! It's always too much or too little.

451	Horn of Plenty	I'll tell you, friend, I thought I knew about making use of every bit of an animal. No siree, as my pal Mimina would say. People pay good gil to bedeck themselves in bits that ain't good enough to eat, tan or boil down to glue! Anyway, get me those bracelets and I'll show you prompt gratitude.	1	4044	117	65	0	3958293	0	119	8	3	0	263	263	79	0	42	80013	917863	110035	5	14	0	1	12	0	18	5	6
452	A Needle Is a Small Sword	Ah, what a pleasure it is to do business with an adventurer so spruce. Many of your brethren are woefully lacking in the area of sartorial upkeep, and this we must remedy.

453	All That Glitters	Quite the storm of adoration over Franz the Fair these days, if I may say so. You might be pleased to learn that Ashgana's has won the bid to sell replicas of his ear cuffs.

454	The Tusk at Hand	Ashgana's provides backing for enterprising young traders, as you know. One such merchant now has a going concern in the Ebony Stalls and is very happy to oblige whenever we have a mind to test Gridania's appetites.

He's one of the tailors who does a deal of good work for the Caravans, and these needles are to replace all those he's worn out making our wares. Do I not say, \xe2\x80\x9cNo one loses by handclasping with us\xe2\x80\x9d?	1	8114	140	67	0	2540087	0	120	8	3	0	271	271	79	0	42	80013	917616	110036	10	14	0	1	12	0	18	5	6

Gorgets now, that's something they've not got.	1	7744	244	67	0	2540087	0	120	8	3	0	271	271	79	0	42	80013	917617	110036	10	14	0	1	12	0	18	5	6
458	Better Four Eyes than None	I have ever profited, it seems, simply by seeing what is right there for all to see. The days grow shorter and the dispatches more urgent.

459	Brothers in Arms	One cannot help but notice the way the gazes of youthful smiths and carpenters flicker over the bracelets and armlets of sailors and stevedores.

460	Forever 21K	On the street, all that glitters is far more likely to be brass than gold. It would take a sharp eye indeed to discern from gold a bit of pinchbeck made by skilled and loving hands.

464	I Am a Rock	Never heard of danburite, I take it? Tcha, how we judge the value of a gem or man...the family worth, elected by hardness and rarity; the measure of the specimen, its hue and clarity; the addled allure for ones who would possess it; and the merit seen by those versed in nature lapidary or human.	1	13146	441	69	0	4067692	0	118	8	3	0	39	39	79	0	39	80013	917624	110038	15	14	0	1	12	0	19	5	6

466	King for a Day	Business has been good for us lately. While nothing is pressing, this would be an excellent time to lay in extra stock of certain items, I believe.

469	Dog Tags Are for Dogs	With so many new faces among the Wailers every day, we fear that time may come when we know not who it is among us that has fallen in service of the commonfolk. If every Wailer were given a ring, on the inside of which is inscribed his name and whence he hails, it would ease our fears.	1	7331	242	71	0	2257677	0	13	8	2	0	129	129	79	0	56	80012	917557	110006	20	14	0	1	12	0	26	5	6
470	One and Only	The Gridanian antelope keeps its horns for life, and the more romantic among thaumaturges see special import in this fact. A former Wailer plies his trade as an engraver near Arrzaneth Ossuary, and he writes that he has seen no fewer than two score horn staves this moon.	1	13250	243	71	0	2257677	0	13	8	2	0	129	129	79	0	56	80012	917558	110006	20	14	0	1	12	0	18	5	6
471	Love in the Time of Umbra	When shadows fall, worldly passions burn brighter\xe2\x94\x80at least for a time. Love tokens are being exchanged at feverish pitch; silver rings are perennially popular. I find myself singularly unmoved, if I may say so. The more one knows of love, the less inclined one is to trade baubles.	1	19770	247	72	0	4067692	0	118	8	3	0	39	39	79	0	39	80013	917865	110038	25	14	0	1	12	0	18	5	6
472	Thaumaturge Is Magic	As a tribute to a thaumaturge of great skill, the Wood Wailers wish to commission a finely chased ring set with deep-violet fluorspar. Magic has as many ways as there are shades of this luminous stone, and none suits his like the noble purple of this incandescent gem.	1	33100	210	72	0	2257677	0	13	8	3	0	129	129	79	0	56	80013	917866	110019	25	14	0	1	12	0	19	5	6
473	All Booked Up	The Order of Nald'thal has been making copies of its library in preparation for the worst. The thought of Arrzaneth Ossuary falling to the enemy is a sobering idea. The most valuable tomes are being copied in miniature so they may be secreted away; the thaumaturges seek spectacles for this reason.	1	11115	618	72	0	4067692	0	118	8	3	0	39	39	79	0	39	80013	917867	110038	25	14	0	1	12	0	26	5	6
474	Necklet of Champions	The Sylvan Tournament is fast approaching, and the prize\xe2\x94\x80a year's supply of suet\xe2\x94\x80has been deemed cumbersome at the last minute. Pleasing gems and noble metals always being the safe choice in these matters, artisans are requested to deliver a worthy trophy before the blue moon.	1	19770	248	73	0	2257677	0	13	8	2	0	129	129	79	0	56	80012	917868	110019	25	14	0	1	12	0	18	5	6
475	Keep the Change	There is gil and there is gold. And then there are gems. The Wailers use all three to pay their debts, but the last has never been favored, for loose stones so often become lost stones. Crafted into jewelry however, they are far easier to keep and worth more to boot.	1	22066	404	73	0	2257677	0	13	8	2	0	129	129	79	0	56	80012	917869	110019	25	14	0	1	12	0	18	5	6
476	Dancing with the Stars	The forest is a fruitful place for augury and of late, the stars sidle close like a bearer of secrets delicious and dangerous. All we lack are thaumaturges' arms of antelope horn to give human voice to these murmurs. Make haste, for the stars wait for no man as the trees hurry for no woman.	1	11115	640	73	0	2257677	0	13	8	2	0	129	129	79	0	56	80012	917870	110019	25	14	0	1	12	0	26	5	6
477	He Has His Quartz	Master Gegeruju's open-handedness is as genuine as it is legendary. Last night, he chanced to hear an improvisatore compose on the theme of \xe2\x80\x9clens of time,\xe2\x80\x9d and not only does he secure her a worthy theatrical agent, he wishes to give her a silver circlet set with goshenite of the first water.	1	47824	386	74	0	3999030	0	113	8	3	0	206	206	79	0	32	80013	917871	110031	30	14	0	1	12	0	19	5	6
478	One Man's Trash	This year has seen a large number of culls, and the horns of beasts so destroyed have a certain beauty. The Calamity is likely to blame for the contortions of nature that necessitated the cull, but even a blighted tree may yield sweet fruit\xe2\x94\x80would you not agree?	1	30282	443	74	0	4067692	0	118	8	3	0	39	39	79	0	39	80013	917872	110038	30	14	0	1	12	0	18	5	6
479	A Little Bird Told Me	When a lovely young person with expensive tastes finds creditors at the door, I find it worthwhile to buy their debt. Then? Why, then they are free. And grateful. One of my pretty birds now has the affections of the tycoon Master Gegeruju, and sings sweetly of his sudden interest in malachite...	1	17670	348	257	0	4067692	0	118	8	3	0	39	39	79	0	39	80013	917873	110038	30	14	0	1	12	0	26	5	6
480	Renascence Man	Passions revive in Master Gegeruju like sap rising in a springtime copse. Having recalled a boyhood lesson from a naturalist, he has entranced us by creating a floating compass out of needles. Such fun\xe2\x94\x80and now done! 'Tis time to restock the sewing cases and make safe the reflecting pool.	1	31098	296	75	0	3999030	0	113	8	1	0	206	206	79	0	32	80011	917874	110031	30	14	0	1	12	0	18	5	6
481	It's Only Love	Love has the master in its Garuda-like grip yet again. This time, he seeks a necklet of moon-bright silver for his inamorata...or was it inamorato? No matter, one is very like the other. The master seeks a beautiful bauble for his beloved; let it be so. 	1	30282	404	75	0	3999030	0	113	8	1	0	206	206	79	0	32	80011	917875	110031	30	14	0	1	12	0	18	5	6
482	Get the Green Stuff	All play and no work makes Master Gegeruju a mere dilettante, and that he shall never be. With his usual, almost preternatural understanding of coming fads, the master has pinpointed malachite jewelry as the coming obsession for Ul'dahn aesthetes, the arbiters of high-society fashion. 	1	17670	348	258	0	3999030	0	113	8	1	0	206	206	79	0	32	80011	917876	110031	30	14	0	1	12	0	26	5	6
483	Actually, It's Loyalty\xc2\xa0	The Holy See of Ishgard is appointing new clerics to its special inquisitors' office, and they want...a harmless bracelet of office. Ah, what a relief\xe2\x94\x80I mean, what an honor. I am sure that the Holy See will rid the inquisition of its rougher edges.

484	Lode It Up	I confess, I do enjoy it when some feral prospector upsets the apple cart. One of these worthies has come upon a massive mythril deposit, and the bubble so carefully blown by the mythril cartel has gone \xe2\x80\x9cpop!\xe2\x80\x9d like a stoat.

485	Burning the Midnight Oil	The bill for lamp oil is up at Arrzaneth Ossuary, remains steady at Stillglade Fane, and is down at the Arcanists' Guild. Clearly, the thaumaturges' numbers grow and their influence waxes; we must build up a stock of arms without delay.	1	23940	359	259	0	4067692	0	118	8	3	0	39	39	79	0	39	80013	917969	110038	35	14	0	1	12	0	26	5	6
486	Wear Your Patriotic Pin	\xe2\x80\x9cPure as peridot,\xe2\x80\x9d goes the popular expression in the streets and drawing rooms of Ishgard. A woman who carries neither the sword nor the issue of a knight would do well to make known her devotion to the cause. To go unadorned with the pale stone is now cause for mistrust.	1	42114	473	77	0	3643002	0	122	8	2	0	385	385	79	0	63	80012	917970	110062	35	14	0	1	12	0	18	5	6
487	Dead Can't Defang	Deprived of their regular prey, wolves now stalk the caravan routes of Coerthas to ambush travelers and traders. An amulet of wolf fangs is said to protect its wearer, and there is a certain logic in it. The dead can hardly collect these fangs from a wolf and sell them as amulets.	1	41034	404	77	0	3643002	0	122	8	2	0	385	385	79	0	63	80012	917971	110062	35	14	0	1	12	0	18	5	6
488	Faith and Fashion	Did you know that the tradition of mythril earrings dates back to Haldrath, the first Azure Dragoon? I confess I did not. Of all the bits he must have worn during the Founding Wars, I cannot see why the earrings are of import. Icons, symbols, and idols\xe2\x94\x80they are not for me to understand.	1	23940	424	260	0	3643002	0	122	8	2	0	385	385	79	0	63	80012	917972	110062	35	14	0	1	12	0	26	5	6
489	Coral on My Mind	The knights of Ishgard also look to the arcanists' art for a new weapon against the dragons. Their reading of the grimoires has revealed that coral is found in the brain of dragons. The knights seek a ring of true coral to pry open the magical implications of this disquieting fact.	1	83662	415	78	0	3643494	0	123	8	3	0	402	402	79	0	63	80013	917973	110063	40	14	0	1	12	0	19	5	6

I've never seen such adroit self-promotion\xe2\x94\x80this up-and-comer wears showy jewelry, then hawks replicas. He has a future in commerce once his fighting days are done.

491	It's My Business to Know Things	First item of business: a rush order of coral bracelets. Gegeruju has beaten us to the punch with this craze, the primals take him.

492	North Ore South	Commerce is an ocean, and there are as many tides as there are goods to trade. Now the mythril flows north, to clad Ishgardians against dragon breath.

496	Gold Is So Last Year	There is a faddish austerity movement afoot in Gridania. They eschew gold\xe2\x94\x80in favor of electrum. They renounce jade\xe2\x94\x80and embrace amber. Other traders feel that both together is too much, but I shall have these circlets displayed alongside huge collars of jade and gold.

497	The Big Red	The market for coral bracelets is played out, but the hunger for the beautiful material remains. We must bring this craze to a head, and hence to a dignified end.

501	Water, Water Everywhere	Following the Calamity, which saw many of the shallower creeks in the North Shroud dry up completely, a large number of beastkin began an exodus to the Central Shroud in search of fresh water. Unfortunately, some of these creatures can prove extremely violent, and there have already been reports of livestock going missing and children being attacked. To ensure the safety of those who reside in the area, the Trappers' League is petitioning adventurers to seek out the invasive species and slay them.	0.8	0	0	1	0	2648030	3251851	20	1	2	0	90	90	75	0	54	80012	65602	110008	1	14	20	1	34	4	6	5	6
502	No Bane, No Gain	To help them build a resistance to deadly toxins, all Wood Wailer initiates must inhale ever-increasing quantities of poisonous funguar spores daily for a period of seven moons.

504	Stay for a Vile	As their name implies, vilekin are foul creatures who spread filth and disease. Not only are their constant buzzings a nuisance, but their bites can invoke all manner of blights and sicknesses. To protect the local fauna from these pests, the Trappers' League, with approval from Stillglade Fane, has not only issued an edict allowing the hunting of certain vilekin, but will pay good gil when presented with proof of extermination.	0.8	0	0	1	0	2648030	3251851	20	1	2	0	90	90	75	0	54	80012	65609	110008	1	14	20	1	34	4	11	5	6

507	Bug Looks Like a Lady	Ladybugs may be classified as vilekin, but they are anything but vile. In fact, they feed on the very vermin who infest our crops here at the Red Rooster Stead, making them more than welcome in our fields. That is, the ones who aren't carrying the terrible leafbleed blight. Rumor states several infected ladybugs hitched a ride on a merchant's vessel carrying fruit from Gridania. Now, not only are they spreading the sickness to the crops, but to healthy La Noscean ladybugs as well. The Stead is looking for adventurers to seek out the carriers of the blight and eliminate them, trying not to harm any of the unaffected ladybugs in the process.	0.8	0	0	1	0	3998968	4167141	46	1	1	0	200	200	75	0	31	80011	65702	110028	1	14	20	1	34	4	6	5	6

509	Ain't Nobody Got Time for Rats	Every summer, we lose more than a quarter of our yield here at the Red Rooster Stead to a plague of filthy rats who sneak into the fields at night and eat the young vegetables straight off the vine. Every winter, we lose another quarter to the same rats when they chew their way into our storage silos. If the quick-breeding pests are not continuously dealt with, our losses will grow even larger, and I will be forced to abandon the farm. The Stead seeks fleet-footed adventurers to come and chase down the creatures so that my family and I might rest easily. 	0.8	0	0	1	0	3998968	4167140	46	1	1	0	200	200	75	0	31	80011	65704	110028	1	14	20	1	34	4	7	5	6
510	A Long and Winding Road	We Yellowjackets of the second levy are ordered to patrol the myriad roads of middle and lower La Noscea, ensuring safe passage for the merchants and travelers who frequent them. Unfortunately, since the Calamity, there are simply not enough men and women in our ranks to cover every malm, which is why we seek the assistance of adventurers in slaying those beasts who wander too close to the outlets.	0.8	0	0	1	0	3998968	4167143	53	1	1	0	200	200	75	0	31	80011	65705	110028	1	14	20	1	34	4	11	5	6
511	On the Lamb	Ever since our old sheep hound was mangled by a pair of megalocrabs, his replacement has caused us nothing but trouble. Not only does the flea-ridden mutt run slower than a one-legged stag, but he spends most of the day looking for some tree to mark, when he isn't eating the chickens' feed. Thanks to him, we lose nigh on half a dozen of our flock every day, which is why, until our faithful old hound's legs heal, we require adventurers to find the stray sheep and lead them back to the Stead. They may be a tad overstrung, so a little coercing with your blade may be required before soothing them.	0.8	0	0	1	0	3998968	4167142	48	1	1	0	200	200	75	0	31	80011	65706	110028	1	14	20	1	34	4	23	5	6
512	Bug Bites	There are some types of vilekin which we welcome on the Red Rooster Stead, one of those being ladybugs, for they feed upon the foul aphids who suck the lifeblood from our crops. The local puks, however, consider the ladybugs a delicacy, and will descend from their rocky nests every morning to feast. The Stead is offering good coin to any adventurer who will travel to the nearby rocky outcroppings, lure out the hungry puks, and slay them. We would also appreciate it if, in your search for the puks, you come across any ladybugs infected with leafbleed, you deal with them, as well.	0.8	0	0	1	0	3998968	4167143	46	1	1	0	200	200	75	0	31	80011	65707	110028	1	14	20	1	34	4	40	5	6
513	Road Rage	Not a day goes by when one of our caravans is not assaulted by some creature lurking behind some tree or boulder. Our birds are trained to flee from any danger, and the mercenary escorts we have in our employ do a fine job of fending off attacks. Still, sacks torn and crates broken in these assaults account for a great deal of lost profits, and the Seventy-Seven Caravans cannot afford to lose any more cargo than we already have. Therefore, we seek adventurers to patrol our trade routes and clear the roadsides of any beasts that may be looking to ambush our birds.	0.8	0	0	1	0	3958072	3956699	83	1	3	0	263	263	75	0	42	80013	65690	110022	1	14	20	1	34	4	6	5	6

515	Nothing Compares to Shrews	It may surprise you, but the leading cause of injury to our organization's chocobos is not ambushes by bloodthirsty beastkin, but shrewhills! Stepping in one of these holes can snap a bird's leg in two, leaving him incapacitated for months...or in serious cases, force us to put him down.

518	Berries Got Bucked	Last night, a pair of peistes ambushed a three-chocobo caravan, killing one bird and sending the other two fleeing. The two surviving chocobos arrived back safely at our stables this morning, but their cargo of Black Shroud berries was missing. It is thought that the crates may have been thrown from the birds' backs during the struggle, and might still be lying somewhere near the site of the ambush. The Seventy-Seven Caravans are seeking adventurers to travel into western Thanalan and attempt to locate and retrieve the missing cargo.

519	We Didn't Start the Fire	A fire set by poachers to flush animals out of their dens and into waiting traps has destroyed a large tract of woodland in the Central Shroud. Subsequent efforts to reforest the area by local botanists have been hampered by the unprovoked attacks of frenzied woodland creatures. To safeguard the lives of the men and women working diligently to restore the wood to its former glory, the Greatloam Growery is calling for adventurers to aid in culling the ravenous beastkin.	0.8	0	0	162	0	2648030	3251855	23	1	2	0	90	90	75	0	54	80012	65605	110009	5	14	20	1	34	4	6	5	6
520	A Vine Finer than Twine	In the past, ropes spun from the hardy, readily available grass known as brambleweed were used to lash together the logs employed in the construction of temporary Wood Wailer encampments\xe2\x94\x80the lone drawback being that the ropes required regular replacement due to weathering. Nowadays, the material is rarely used, since it was discovered that microchu vines not only provide the strength of grass-based rope, but last a great deal longer due to their uncanny refusal to wither. The Lancers' Guild is currently in the process of refortifying its garrisons and will generously reward those who bring them suitable microchu vines.	0.8	0	0	162	0	2648030	3251855	21	1	2	0	90	90	75	0	54	80012	65606	110009	5	14	20	1	34	4	10	5	6

522	A Full Stomach	Recent communion with the spirits of the Twelveswood reveals that a plague of vilekin has descended upon the forest. The plague has, in turn, caused an explosion in the population of the landtraps which feed upon the tiny pests. If left unattended, the vilekin will continue to feed the landtraps, who will eventually overtake the wood, killing off many of the other native flora. Stillglade Fane is committed to restoring balance to the forest and is offering rewards to any who help in the extermination efforts.	0.8	0	0	162	0	2648030	3251855	24	1	2	0	90	90	75	0	54	80012	65612	110009	5	14	20	1	34	4	11	5	6
523	Wrangling Raptors	Recently, a Gods' Quiver scout was stopped by a local farmer who claims to have seen goblins using raptors the way we use chocobos\xe2\x94\x80as beasts of burden. At first, the scout believed the farmer to be lying, for it is well documented that scalekin of such violent temperament cannot be tamed. However, after being led to the hillock where the pack raptor was first seen, the scout was convinced. Now, it is simply a matter of capturing a few of these domesticated raptors alive, and a sizable reward is being offered to any who can do so.	0.8	0	0	162	0	2648030	3251855	25	1	2	0	90	90	75	0	54	80012	65613	110009	5	14	20	1	34	4	23	5	6
524	Compost with the Most	The Greatloam Growery has spent the last five summers spreading compost about the Twelveswood in an effort to re-enrich soil which was left barren and tainted by fiends. Botanist parties journey into the forest daily to conduct this task; and while most are left unmolested by the woodland creatures, it is not uncommon for a party to become the victim of an attack. In these situations, the botanists are trained to literally drop what they are doing and Return to the guild. While this saves lives, it leaves a great deal of valuable compost to rot in the field, which is why the Growery seeks to hire adventurers who will travel into the forest and recover the abandoned sacks.	0.8	0	0	162	0	2648030	3251855	23	1	2	0	90	90	75	0	54	80012	65614	110009	5	14	20	1	34	4	40	5	6

526	No Pain, No Grain	Before grain can be milled into flour, it must be dried. During the Sixth Astral Era, we would dry our wheat in the dry salt winds that came down the Strait of Merlthor. The past five years, however, those winds have been warm and wet. Not only does it prevent the grain from drying properly, but it breeds mold. For this reason, we have opted to abandon the traditional methods of drying for a new technique using the cores from wind sprites. Drying is much quicker and more efficient, the only drawback being that none of us here at the Grey Fleet are competent enough with a blade to procure the cores ourselves. So, we must ask the aid of adventurers.	0.8	0	0	163	0	3998968	4167146	49	1	1	0	200	200	75	0	31	80011	65709	110029	5	14	20	1	34	4	10	5	6
527	March of the Mandragoras	Forty summers at the Red Rooster Stead, and not once did I see a mandragora...until the Calamity, that is. In a matter of months, the countryside was crawling with the seedkin. At first, we thought them to be harmless. We never saw them feed on other plants, and they never bothered us, no matter how close we got. That is, until we began seeing smaller yields in the fields where the mandragoras roamed. After watching them for a full season, we found that the podlings were using tiny roots on their feet to tap the soil of its nutrients. When we tried to remove the mandragoras ourselves, we learned that they were not as peaceful as we once thought... Now, we seek the aid of adventurers skilled in these sorts of matters to dispose of the nuisances.	0.8	0	0	163	0	3998968	4167145	47	1	1	0	200	200	75	0	31	80011	65710	110029	5	14	20	1	34	4	7	5	6

530	Far from the Vine	Most of them former pirates or street urchins, the majority of my field hands spend more time finding ways to dodge their duties than actually harvesting fruit...which is why most of my grapes still sit, rotting on the vine. The bottlers in Wineport have begun to grow restless, threatening to commission another farmstead if we cannot make our quota, and there is little hope that my employees will have a change of heart in the next few turns of the sun, so I am forced to turn to adventurers for aid. You need only pluck the grapes from the vine and deliver them to me, and you shall be paid handsomely. Just...beware of the bees attracted to the smell of the sweet fruit.	0.8	0	0	163	0	3998968	4167148	46	1	1	0	200	200	75	0	31	80011	65713	110029	5	14	20	1	34	4	40	5	6

532	The Ore the Better	To rebuild and reinforce the many buildings lost in the Calamity, copious amounts of high-quality iron mined in Vylbrand must be imported from Limsa Lominsa. Knowing that their mines are the only truly reliable source of the ore, the dirty pirates, taking a page out of the sultanate's own book, have driven the prices up to ludicrous amounts. While those with the means will continue to purchase the high-quality Lominsan product, we seek to provide an alternative to those less endowed, and believe that a lower grade of ore known as \xe2\x80\x9ccoblyn pyrite\xe2\x80\x9d may be the key.	0.8	0	0	164	0	3958072	3956702	83	1	3	0	263	263	75	0	42	80013	65697	110023	5	14	20	1	34	4	10	5	6
533	Needles to Say	Increased rains in Thanalan since the Calamity have seen the population of cactuars explode, putting more and more travelers in danger of becoming victims of thousand-pronged attacks. The Brass Blades request the aid of well-armored adventurers to seek out the seedkin and return them to the soil. It is recommended that volunteers come dressed lightly, for when threatened, cactuars will often attempt to flee, and heavy armor will only prove a burden to the pursuer.	0.8	0	0	164	0	3958072	3956704	85	1	3	0	263	263	75	0	42	80013	65698	110023	5	14	20	1	34	4	7	5	6
534	Procession of the Noble	The sultana has declared she will soon make a journey to Scorpion Crossing to provide her royal blessing to the people who have labored there to rebuild their lives. The Sultansworn will see that she is provided with more than enough protection; however, no chances can be taken. The royal court seeks adventurers to travel to Scorpion Crossing and clear the area of any and all threats before the procession begins.	0.8	0	0	164	0	3958072	3956701	84	1	3	0	263	263	75	0	42	80013	65699	110023	5	14	20	1	34	4	11	5	6
535	A Spoonful of Poison	There is a fine line between that which we call medicine, and that which we call poison. Ofttimes to purge the body of an evil, a greater evil must be introduced. Poisons, however, can be difficult to come by, with the more potent varieties coming from the more deadly creatures. Still, progress requires sacrifice, and I am more than willing to sacrifice sizable sums of coin for you to sacrifice your life and limb in procuring me the most terrible of toxins. I shall even provide you with special nerve drops which can be used to calm even the most agitated of beasts...so that you may capture them alive.	0.8	0	0	164	0	3958072	3956702	86	1	3	0	263	263	75	0	42	80013	65700	110023	5	14	20	1	34	4	23	5	6
536	Two Yalms Under	Several days ago, we captured a petty thief as he attempted to make off with a bejeweled goblet from Eshtaime's Aesthetics. After a few days in the oubliettes, he began admitting to previous crimes, and how he hid his loot in the desert. The short-manned Brass Blades cannot afford to send a unit into the wilds to hunt for treasure, but will reward any adventurer who returns with the pilfered items.	0.8	0	0	164	0	3958072	3956704	87	1	3	0	263	263	75	0	42	80013	65701	110023	5	14	20	1	34	4	40	5	6
537	Going Green	Leafbleed slugs have infested the stable's gysahl fields, infecting almost a third of this season's crop. Without the greens, many of our chocobos will not survive the winter.

538	Infestation Cessation	Carrion chigoes are filthy pests who, through their foul bites, spread deadly plagues, such as the Creeping Death, throughout the Twelveswood. To prevent a full-blown infestation of the vilekin, the Wood Wailers seek volunteers to slay the creatures and bring back egg sacs as proof of their deeds.	0.8	0	0	165	0	1672782	3244753	27	1	2	0	94	94	75	0	54	80012	65564	110001	10	14	20	1	34	4	10	5	6
539	Turning Out the Blight	Of late, ever-increasing numbers of blight-bearing leafbleed slugs and mites have begun to appear in the vicinity of Bentbranch Meadows. The Seedseers believe that the infestation is a result of the over-culling of the vilekin's natural predators by the influx of new adventurers. We at Moogle's Gift Mounts care little for causes, however, and seek those willing to lend their blades in finding a solution to the problem at hand before the pests turn their attentions to our flock.	0.8	0	0	165	0	1672782	3251848	28	1	2	0	94	94	75	0	54	80012	65568	110001	10	14	20	1	34	4	7	5	6
540	Bump in the Night	Damnable imps and their nightfires have my flock so full of fright they cannot get a wink of sleep, and no sensible man will pay good coin for a bird what's dead on her feet.

541	Wail of a Tale	The restless souls of Wood Wailers who were slain in battle, but never had their bodies retrieved for a proper sending into the afterlife, are said to aimlessly roam the forest near Bentbranch, striking fear into the smallfolk who work the local stables. Stillglade Fane wishes to ease the pain of these spirits by releasing them from their corporeal bonds and returning their bodies to the Twelveswood. They would appreciate any and all assistance offered by local adventurers, and are prepared to offer a small stipend to those who lend their aid.	0.8	0	0	165	0	1672782	3244753	24	1	2	0	94	94	75	0	54	80012	65616	110001	10	14	20	1	34	4	11	5	6
542	Hog Wild	Not only is hog meat delicious and high in nutrients, but a single adult hog can fill over four score bellies, six score if those bellies are Lalafellin. Hogs, however, are an extremely violent lot, with over five percent of the Twelveswood's yearly casualties attributed to tusk-gouging. This is why the Trappers' League has proposed the domestication of the beasts, and is actively seeking adventurers to capture hoglets and deliver them, live, to league-run pens.	0.8	0	0	165	0	1672782	3251848	20	1	2	0	94	94	75	0	54	80012	65617	110001	10	14	20	1	34	4	23	5	6
543	Scent of a Roselet	The Greatloam Growery is seeking to determine why, unlike many other forest seedkin, roselets appear to thrive in the post-Calamity Twelveswood. The hopes are that the answers uncovered in this study will help give insight into how the guild might help accelerate the recovery process in other parts of the forest. To do this, they require living samples, pacified and delivered, and are willing to pay a sizable sum of gil for each one.	0.8	0	0	165	0	1672782	3251849	23	1	2	0	94	94	75	0	54	80012	65618	110001	10	14	20	1	34	4	23	5	6
544	Mite and Madness	The spirits fear that the recent increase in mites living in the Central Shroud will disturb the area's natural balance, sending the forest into chaos. To see this fate averted, Stillglade Fane requests the aid of adventurers in the culling of the mite population. This includes the gathering and disposal of eggs from mite holes.	0.8	0	0	165	0	1672782	3251850	29	1	2	0	94	94	75	0	54	80012	65619	110001	10	14	20	1	34	4	40	5	6
545	A Shroom with a View	The Greatloam Growery has set up logs near Bentbranch on which we hope to harvest several sorts of edible mushrooms. As luck would have it, however, the area we chose has become overrun with terrible wild beasts, preventing us untrained in the arts of battle from checking up on the progress of our crops. We seek capable men and women to travel to the logs in our stead and determine if they require additional tending.	0.8	0	0	165	0	1672782	3251848	23	1	2	0	94	94	75	0	54	80012	65620	110001	10	14	20	1	34	4	40	5	6
546	Too Close to Home	A pack of anoles has been spotted near Bentbranch Meadows, far from their usual hunting grounds on Naked Rock. The local chocobokeeps are worried that it is only a matter of time before the hungry scalekin stray too close to the stables and endanger their birds. To prevent the worst, the Wood Wailers are seeking volunteers to find and cull the creatures.\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03\xe2\x80\xbbLevequest objectives are deemed complete when all targets have been slain.

547	A Tall Odor	I don't suppose you've ever smelled a jackal. It's like sticking your head up an aldgoat's arse and finding a Sahagin corpse covered in moldy stone cheese...but worse (not that I've ever stuck my head up an aldgoat's arse, mind you). Well, to make a long story short, a pack of the foul beasts has taken a liking to the patch of soft grass outside my bedroom window, and now I cannot get a wink of sleep for the smell. I don't care what it takes, I'm ready to pay a sennight's worth of my dock pay to any man who can rid me of those dogs.	0.8	0	0	166	0	2540254	4165477	51	1	1	0	218	218	75	0	33	80011	65590	110020	10	14	20	1	34	4	6	5	6
548	The Sprite of Competition	Ever since Wawalago began posting each puller's daily catch count on the guild wall, the competition to be number one has become brutal...to the point that some pullers are even resorting to thievery and sabotage. I, on the other hand, have opted to use my boundless wit to get ahead. My plan is to toss the cores of lightning sprites into the sea, and then simply scoop up the stunned fish as they float to the top. Brilliant, wouldn't you say? Now, all I need are a few fresh cores, and am ready to pay top gil for them.	0.8	0	0	166	0	2540254	4165468	150	1	1	0	218	218	75	0	33	80011	65591	110020	10	14	20	1	34	4	10	5	6
549	Jackal and the Livestock	Jackals are known to feed on carrion, too cowardly to attack a living creature; however, there have been reports of a certain pack which has grown bold, attacking weakened and diseased beastkin before they die. If left alone, it may not be long before the pack begins hunting the area's livestock...or even worse\xe2\x94\x80its tenders.

550	Shock Therapy	A pair of troublemaking imps have disguised themselves as lightning sprites and taken to literally shocking innocent travelers along the De Nevelle Westroad. The Yellowjackets seek volunteers to locate the imps and slay them. This can be accomplished by first collecting pollen clusters from local roselings, and then sprinkling the irritant on suspicious-looking sprites.	0.8	0	0	166	0	2540254	4165468	55	1	1	0	218	218	75	0	33	80011	65593	110020	10	14	20	1	34	4	13	5	6
551	At the Gates	North and South Tidegate serve to protect the central and eastern parts of La Noscea from the Sahagin and their mindless servants, the Serpent Reavers, so it is imperative that the outposts are well supplied. Caravans delivering rations and materiel traverse the De Nevelle Westroad daily, but only a fraction of the birds ever arrive, due to frequent ambushes. The Yellowjackets have already bolstered their presence at several checkpoints along the route, but require the aid of adventurers to patrol the areas they cannot cover.	0.8	0	0	166	0	2540254	4165475	55	1	1	0	218	218	75	0	33	80011	65594	110020	10	14	20	1	34	4	11	5	6

Well, it could be that I, too, wouldn't mind a fresh roasted leg every now and again while on those long sea journeys, and am ready to pay a fair sum of coin for any dodo delivered to me alive.	0.8	0	0	166	0	2540254	4165468	50	1	1	0	218	218	75	0	33	80011	65686	110020	10	14	20	1	34	4	23	5	6

555	No Egg to Stand On	Believe it or not, the area around Swiftperch was once covered with golden sunset wheat as far as the eye could see. The Calamity, however, put an end to that, claiming the lives of the men and women who tended the land. With no one to till the fields, they were quickly reclaimed by nature's firm grasp. The remaining residents of Swiftperch still dream of a day when the fields run gold again, and a few of us are working to see that dream realized. We have already begun to clear away trees and rocks, but when it comes to the wild dodos which now live on the old farms, we are helpless, and must request the aid of adventurers. We don't ask that you slay the beasts, but merely take their eggs so this generation is their last.	0.8	0	0	166	0	2540254	4165479	51	1	1	0	218	218	75	0	33	80011	65688	110020	10	14	20	1	34	4	40	5	6

557	Reeking Havoc	The stagnant pools which have collected around the recently uncovered ruins in the Footfalls are prime spawning locations for all sorts of putrid-smelling wavekin such as orobon and gigantoads.

558	Skin Deep	While peisteskin garments have long been popular in Ul'dah, the people of the city-state prefer the thin, supple skins of post-molt peistes to the tough, glossy skins of pre-molt ones. The thin skins, however, have never sold well in Limsa Lominsa, where the weather is colder and wetter. Could it be that Lominsans might prefer the thicker skins? If so, the Seventy-Seven Caravans need to know, and are petitioning adventurers to help them gather the item.	0.8	0	0	167	0	2540071	3446677	88	1	3	0	271	271	75	0	42	80013	65579	110026	10	14	20	1	34	4	10	5	6

563	You Cannot Kill the Metal	With assistance from the Alchemists' Guild, Amajina & Sons have discovered a new method of extracting the small traces of metal from low-grade ore containing high quantities of impurities. This method requires feeding coblyns ore and then waiting for the creatures' bodies to pass the impurities. Once the impurities have left its body, the coblyn is thrown into a forge where the body is burned away, leaving only pure metal\xe2\x94\x80the only drawback being the coblyn is lost in the process. And thus, the Mineral Concern is seeking adventurers to pacify and capture living coblyns, and will pay for each one delivered.	0.8	0	0	167	0	2540071	3446677	91	1	3	0	271	271	75	0	42	80013	65632	110026	10	14	20	1	34	4	23	5	6

565	From Ruins to Riches	If a man told you he was thankful for the destruction wrought during the Calamity, you would most likely think his brain addled. Well, for a scholar of antiquity such as myself, the Calamity was a godssend, for it uncovered a wealth of knowledge in the form of ruins from eras past. If only it had come sooner, I would have had more time to document all the wonders! Now, in the twilight of my years in this realm, I am unable to make the long, perilous journeys to the unearthed cities. I can, however, offer coin to adventurers who would make the journey in my stead and bring back relics so that I may study them here in my home.	0.8	0	0	167	0	2540071	3446678	92	1	3	0	271	271	75	0	42	80013	65634	110026	10	14	20	1	34	4	40	5	6
566	What Peistes Crave	It is a well-documented fact that peistes prefer Lalafell meat to that of the other four races. Various opinions on the reasons behind this have been long debated, with the most widely accepted being that the squat, rotund build of the Lalafell makes them easier to swallow whole. Seeing that the majority of Ul'dah's population is made up of Lalafells, this makes the hills of Thanalan a perfect feeding ground for the giant scalekin, and this is why the Brass Blades are constantly seeking volunteers to travel to the hills and slay the creatures before they find their next meal.	0.8	0	0	167	0	2540071	3446678	89	1	3	0	271	271	75	0	42	80013	65635	110026	10	14	20	1	34	4	7	4	2
567	Monkey Business	A pack of lemurs from the North Shroud and a pack of opo\x02\x1f\x01\x03opos from the South Shroud have both converged on Nine Ivies in search of food, and now fight constantly over foraging rights. These scuffles often take place in or nearby populated areas, and have already caused injuries to livestock and one particularly unfortunate child. To restore balance to the area, the Wood Wailers seek volunteers to assist in thinning both packs so that they may be compelled to return to the corners of the wood whence they came.	0.8	0	0	168	0	1646078	3251859	30	1	2	0	107	107	75	0	55	80012	65569	110003	15	14	20	1	34	4	6	5	6

569	Can't Say No to Gnat	Over the past several moons, once-docile honeybees have grown increasingly violent. Conjurers' Guild officials believe the phenomenon to be the result of a pus gnat infestation. The pus gnat emits a scent similar to, but several times more potent than, that of the honeybee queen, causing soldiers and workers alike to abandon their normal duties and flock to the creature. The gnat, in turn, commands the bees to attack its foes in its stead. If something is not done immediately, it won't be long before all the hives in the Twelveswood are abandoned, and the flow of honey brought to a halt.	0.8	0	0	168	0	1646078	3258961	32	1	2	0	107	107	75	0	55	80012	65571	110003	15	14	20	1	34	4	7	5	6
570	Ochus Bite, Leaves Bleed	Leafbleed is a terrible blight that causes plants to leak their juices until they eventually wither and die. The sickness is normally carried by beast- and vilekin who infect plants when they feed upon them; however, ochus have also been known to be carriers, though why they remain unaffected by the symptoms remains a mystery. To prevent the spread of leafbleed through ochus, the Trappers' League is offering a reward for the slaying of each afflicted seedkin.	0.8	0	0	168	0	1646078	3258961	20	1	2	0	107	107	75	0	55	80012	65572	110003	15	14	20	1	34	4	13	5	6

572	A Guest for Supper	Four summers past, while on my morning walk through the forest, I had the misfortune of happening upon a Coeurlclaw trap. The jaws dug deep, preventing me from removing the foul contraption from my leg. I shouted for help for three straight bells, but this was soon after the Calamity, and there were still few travelers in the area. Before long, the smell of my lifeblood soaking into the forest floor had attracted several hungry beasts, and I knew then that the end was nigh. I closed my eyes and began reciting my final prayers to the Matron...when a Qiqirn emerged from the trees, swiftly drove the beasts away, and removed the trap. If it had not been for that kind creature, I surely would have perished that day, and so ever since, I have invited the Qiqirn down from his hovel to dine at my cookfire. In recent years, he has grown old, and can no longer make the journey here himself, so I seek the services of kind adventurers to assist him on the road.	0.8	0	0	168	0	1646078	3942505	34	1	2	0	107	107	75	0	55	80012	65623	110003	15	14	20	1	34	4	41	5	6

The malicious voidsent now roam western La Noscea, free to torment the poor souls they hap across. The Yellowjackets are petitioning adventurers to aid in their search for the creatures. It is said that the light of the evenfall firefly can dispel an imp's glamour, and all those participating in the hunt are recommended to first collect firefly abdomens and use them on suspicious-looking characters wandering aimlessly about the hills.	0.8	0	0	169	0	2540476	4165482	56	1	1	0	223	223	75	0	33	80011	65597	110021	15	14	20	1	34	4	13	5	6
576	First to Reave	The Serpent Reavers, heartless villains who have sold their souls to the Sahagin for a dream of endless plunder, have increased activity along the De Nevelle Westroad, preying upon weary travelers. The Yellowjackets cannot well cover the whole area and seek adventurers willing to volunteer their blades for irregular patrols.	0.8	0	0	169	0	2540476	4165480	56	1	1	0	223	223	75	0	33	80011	65598	110021	15	14	20	1	34	4	11	5	6
577	Beasts of Bourbon	No doubt you've seen the giant aurochs which graze in the nearby hills. Word has it they were brought over from some far-off land generations ago to be raised and bred for their milk and meat. The Calamity saw that experiment to an end, and now the remaining beasts have grown wild and taken to attacking their former masters. I reckon, however, that if one were able to pacify the creatures they could once again be domesticated. My distillery could use a few strong aurochs to bear bourbon casks to Limsa, and I'd be willing to pay any man who could accommodate me.	0.8	0	0	169	0	2540476	4165483	58	1	1	0	223	223	75	0	33	80011	65599	110021	15	14	20	1	34	4	23	5	6
578	Field Testing	I take pride in the quality of my ale, so I make certain to personally test each batch before shipping to ensure my customers will be satisfied. The only problem is, ofttimes I test a tad more than might be necessary. Such was the case last night when, after a bell or five of quality assurance, I woke in a field surrounded by angry aurochs. It wasn't until I was back in my cellar, the door locked firmly behind me, that I realized I had left several bottles of ale in that beast-ridden field. I'd be right appreciative of any soul who might go and retrieve that ale.	0.8	0	0	169	0	2540476	4165483	58	1	1	0	223	223	75	0	33	80011	65600	110021	15	14	20	1	34	4	40	5	6
579	Barley Legal	I'm looking to increase my brewery's output, but, to do so, require a steady supply of quality barley. The farms around Aleport are already under contract with several other brewers and have no more grain to sell, but I have heard word of growers in Swiftperch who might be willing to part with a portion of their crop. As I am not a disciple of any of the martial or magical arts, I fear that I might not make it to the settlement with my life, and therefore am looking to hire an escort who will see to my safety until arriving in Swiftperch.	0.8	0	0	169	0	2540476	4165484	59	1	1	0	223	223	75	0	33	80011	65601	110021	15	14	20	1	34	4	41	5	6

581	The Enterprise of Undeath	There are those who, upon death, are, for whatever reason, unable to make the journey to Thal's realm. These wrathful souls remain trapped in the realm of Nald, where they roam aimlessly, blinded by rage, until they hap across an innocent victim...and, well, the outcome is oft too gruesome to put to parchment. We servants of the Traders wish only to see the tormented back on the proper path, but require the aid of martially inclined adventurers to do so, for the only way to release the undead from this realm is to first break the bond the soul has with its decaying corporeal counterpart. Only then can we conduct the remaining rites to see the soul at peace.	0.8	0	0	170	0	2540213	3446699	80	1	3	0	300	300	75	0	44	80013	65584	110024	15	14	20	1	34	4	6	5	6

583	A Simple Solution	Several mischievous shape-shifting imps charged with setting over a hundred different fires, many of which led to the deaths of humble farmfolk, have escaped from their inescapable cell in the Marasaja Pit. After conducting a realm-wide search to capture the villainous voidsent, the Brass Blades believe they finally have cornered them somewhere in Drybone. To ensure that they do not let the criminals slip through their fingers, the Blades are seeking adventurers to assist in the search process, which involves collecting firefly abdomens and casting them on tuco\x02\x1f\x01\x03tucos\xe2\x94\x80any of which could be an imp\xe2\x94\x80to dissolve the creatures' glamours.	0.8	0	0	170	0	2540213	3446703	93	1	3	0	300	300	75	0	44	80013	65586	110024	15	14	20	1	34	4	13	5	6
584	Death with Indignity	The lichyard of the Church of Saint Adama Landama is the final resting place for those who do not have the means to see their bodies interred in the sultanate's great stone mausoleums. We provide salvation in death for those who could not find the same in life. We ask no coin of those who seek our aid, and conduct our work solely with the alms provided us by the city-state's few philanthropists. Charity, however, is a rare virtue in Ul'dah, and our \xe2\x80\x9cvisitors\xe2\x80\x9d are forced to forgo many of the luxuries, such as a proper headstone or an embalming, that the wealthy are granted upon their passing. This inequity can kindle flames of wrath which can ultimately prevent a soul from completing its journey to the realm of Thal. These souls must needs be cleansed of their anger so that they may find peace, and we at the lichyard seek adventurers to aid us in doing so.	0.8	0	0	170	0	2540213	3446726	80	1	3	0	300	300	75	0	44	80013	65587	110024	15	14	20	1	34	4	10	5	6
585	Going for Goat	Yes, chocobos are quick, strong, and reliable, but with their narrow backs, they can only bear so much burden. But I ask you this\xe2\x94\x80what if one were to train a larger beast, such as an aldgoat? Over twice the cargo could be hauled with half the number of animals! Profits would double, nay triple, overnight! I must test my theory immediately, but, as a mere merchant, do not have the means of taming and pacifying an aldgoat on my own. There is good coin to be made for any adventurer who might help me in seeing my dream realized.	0.8	0	0	170	0	2540213	3446720	94	1	3	0	300	300	75	0	44	80013	65588	110024	15	14	20	1	34	4	23	5	6
586	Earthbound	Since the Calamity, there has been much imbalance in the elements. Founts of over-aspected aether erupt from the soil and manifest into corrupted crystals. These crystals, in turn, attract the most unsavory of creatures, the most common of all being elemental sprites who, upon absorbing the crystals, become corrupted themselves. The Brass Blades are seeking adventurers to comb the desert and find the crystals, slaying any corrupted sprites encountered.	0.8	0	0	170	0	2540213	3446695	93	1	3	0	300	300	75	0	44	80013	65589	110024	15	14	20	1	34	4	40	5	6
587	The Missing Merchant	A Gridanian merchant was to arrive in Ul'dah today to discuss a long-term shipping agreement with the Seventy-Seven Caravans, but even as the twenty-fourth bell struck, he had yet to arrive at the agreed upon meeting place.

588	The Law Won	Despite the fact sultanate law clearly forbids any and all business dealings with beast tribes deemed hostile, a goblin merchant has chosen to ignore the law and peddle his wares to the Amalj'aa. The Brass Blades cannot allow this, and seek adventurers to locate the merchant and bid him cease. He is, however, by no means to be hurt. Goblins are considered harmless and have been granted leave to conduct commerce within the city-state, so we ask that adventurers simply lead him away from Amalj'aa lands towards central Thanalan.	0.8	0	0	170	0	2540213	4085097	93	1	3	0	300	300	75	0	44	80013	65640	110024	15	14	20	1	34	4	41	4	2

592	The Root of the Problem	A pack of normally placid antelopes has grown frenzied and begun attacking botanists participating in the Greatloam Growery's reforestation project. After inspecting the carcass of one of the beastkin, it is believed the animals must have eaten the leaves of the blackroot rose, known to cause horrible visions and induce extreme fits of violence. In their current state, the animals are a threat to the botanists, the forest, and themselves, and so to prevent any further incidents, it has been decided that the antelopes must be put down.

596	Treevenge	A new underhanded technique involving the provocation of peaceful treants to create confusion during robberies is being employed by an increasing number of local highwaymen. What is worse, these angered seedkin remain agitated long after the bandits have done their damage, resulting in a forest overrun with frenzied foliage. To ensure the safety of innocent bystanders, Stillglade Fane has concocted a special formula which, when sprinkled on a weakened treant, should calm the giant creature.

We do not normally experience much in the way of problems...that is, except when we receive a shipment of eggs. Perhaps it is that nose of theirs, but the Qiqirn always seem to know exactly when we have loaded a crate of eggs onto our docks, and will be hiding in wait, ready to pilfer every last one the moment we turn our backs. Killing the rats would be easy, but the remaining ones would simply keep coming back for more. No, I reckon the only way to stop the creatures from coming back is to see that they are bloodied and bruised so that when they return to their dens, they can tell their brethren what awaits them if they try and steal any more eggs.	0.8	0	0	172	0	4018485	4167150	60	1	1	0	337	337	75	0	31	80011	65717	110027	20	14	20	1	34	4	23	5	6
601	Strand by Me	It has been five summers since the Calamity, and still yet little is known of the fantastical change wrought upon the land by the unleashing of Bahamut's aether. The queer formations off the Salt Strand are a prime example. How were these pillars formed? Do they continue to grow? Do they pose a threat? To better understand the phenomena, I am studying the elemental balance in the area, and to do so, require samples of water so that I may measure levels of salt and other minerals.	0.8	0	0	172	0	4018485	4167169	64	1	1	0	337	337	75	0	31	80011	65718	110027	20	14	20	1	34	4	40	5	6
602	Man the Ore	Naldiq & Vymelli's has entered a tentative agreement with a goblin merchant to purchase a sizable quantity of ore his people have gathered while hollowing out the heart of a nearby mountain to create a new city. This new source of ore could mean an end to the current material shortage our company faces, which is why it is imperative that the merchant, currently on his way to Candlekeep Quay to finalize the contract, makes it there safely. Naldiq & Vymelli's is seeking a skilled adventurer to escort the goblin and see that he arrives safely to his destination.	0.8	0	0	172	0	4018485	4167168	63	1	1	0	337	337	75	0	31	80011	65719	110027	20	14	20	1	34	4	41	5	6
603	The Deathliest Catch	Most megalocrabs feed on fish they find in tidal pools or washed up onshore. There is a variety of crab, however, which prefers the flesh of man over that of marine life. These terrible wavekin are called big claws, and must be put down before they injure any more of Candlekeep Quay's residents. It is almost impossible, however, to distinguish a big claw from a normal megalocrab. That is, unless the core of a lightning elemental is used. When shocked, the shell of a big claw will turn bright red, making it an easy target.	0.8	0	0	172	0	4018485	4167151	60	1	1	0	337	337	75	0	31	80011	65720	110027	20	14	20	1	34	4	13	4	2
604	Refugee Raw	Five summers have passed since the Calamity, and yet poor souls seeking succor continue to arrive in Quarrymill with each turn of the sun. Though our humble hamlet no longer has the room to provide these refugees with shelter, we feel that it is at least important to supply them with whatever provisions we can before seeing them back on their journeys. To see our storehouses remain stocked with food, we are petitioning the services of adventurers to hunt the nearby wood for raw antelope meat which we will then smoke and jerk.	0.8	0	0	173	0	2257020	3446785	149	1	2	0	129	129	75	0	56	80012	65641	110018	25	14	20	1	34	4	10	5	6
605	More than Meets the Eye	Two murderous imps captured by a brave band of adventurers and handed over to the Wood Wailers for imprisonment have escaped their chains and somehow stolen from the city. There have been sightings of the voidsent near Quarrymill, and the Holtwatch has already dispatched several units to subdue the fiends. Normally, imps are clever creatures, hiding themselves behind magic glamours, choosing to take up the guise of harmless animals such as galagos or sheep. These ones, however, have chosen to take on the form of Coeurlclaw poachers, making them relatively easy targets for the men and women already hunting the band of thieves. Any assistance in the recapture of the otherworldly escapees is appreciated and will be well rewarded.	0.8	0	0	173	0	2257020	3446785	35	1	2	0	129	129	75	0	56	80012	65642	110018	25	14	20	1	34	4	13	5	6
606	Necrologos: Olidious Separation	A half-crazed cultist belonging to the Lambs of Dalamud was taken into custody after running naked through New Gridania's Aetheryte Plaza, screaming strange obscenities at the awestruck passersby. Though thorough questioning revealed little about who she was or whence she came, her speech was littered with mention of the South Shroud and a forbidden tome known as the \x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03Necrologos\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03. While it may simply turn out to be the ramblings of this poor, addle-brained soul, Stillglade Fane must be certain that a copy of the tome is not lying somewhere in the forest waiting to be found by an unknowing bystander. They seek volunteers to travel south, search the area, and destroy any pages they may find.	0.8	0	0	173	0	2257020	3446765	38	1	2	0	129	129	75	0	56	80012	65643	110018	25	14	20	1	34	4	8	5	6

Unfortunately, me old bag does not share in that enjoyment, which is why I've been temporarily forbidden from leaving me stead. Now I can survive without the thighs or dice, but a night without me drip and I'm sure as dead. Luckily, I keep a bottle or five of me brew hidden nearby, and I'd be more than willing to bestow a share of me gambling winnings upon any kind soul who'd be kind enough to fetch the bottles and deliver them to me door, discreet-like. 	0.8	0	0	173	0	2257020	3446784	39	1	2	0	129	129	75	0	56	80012	65645	110018	25	14	20	1	34	4	40	5	6
609	Rope a 'Lope	Since the Calamity, the Trappers' League, in conjunction with Stillglade Fane and the Wood Wailers, has established a comprehensive set of guidelines regulating hunting in the Twelveswood in order to see diminished beastkin populations return to their Sixth Astral Era size. One of the animals covered in this edict is the antelope\xe2\x94\x80the guidelines specifically stating that the slaying of any stag or doe under the age of three summers is strictly prohibited. The notorious band of poachers known as the Coeurlclaws, however, have little respect for Gridania's laws, and will often kill any and all creatures who enter their territory. To see that young antelopes are spared this fate, the Trappers' League seeks volunteers to help guide wayward does and stags away from the poachers' demesne.	0.8	0	0	173	0	2257020	3943221	20	1	2	0	129	129	75	0	56	80012	65646	110018	25	14	20	1	34	4	41	5	6

However, before she could drive away the cultist herself, a pack of bloodthirsty beasts set upon the man and proceeded to tear him and his book to shreds, consuming every last piece. Stillglade Fane believes the tome the hunter saw to be a copy of the forbidden \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03Necrologos\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03, and is seeking adventurers skilled in the arts of war or magic to locate and slay the beasts in question, and retrieve any pages that may remain in their bellies, taking heed that foul creatures may be trapped within the parchment.	0.8	0	0	173	0	2257020	3446778	38	1	2	0	129	129	75	0	56	80012	65647	110018	25	14	20	1	34	4	8	5	6

Now, the men and women of the Brigade are naught more than petty criminals defiling the name of our proud nation. I would see all of them rot in the seventh hell before calling them brethren.

612	Drakes' Misfortune	It was once believed that imps could only disguise themselves as creatures of similar size or stature. However, it was recently discovered that a skilled imp can transform himself into something several times larger when a Brass Blade patrolling Broken Water witnessed one of the voidsent taking on the form of a massive drake. It is now worried that many of the area's scalekin may actually be shape-shifting imps, and the local authorities seek adventurers to investigate. It is believed that, as is the case with other imps, the cores of fire elementals possess the ability to dissipate the glamours.	0.8	0	0	174	0	3974981	3437847	96	1	3	0	313	313	75	0	45	80013	65649	110025	25	14	20	1	34	4	13	5	6

Do the rumors contain any merit? None employed at the Seventy-Seven Caravans fancies herself a leech or barber, and therefore cannot attest to any of the claims made regarding the flowers' curative properties (or lack thereof).

He has only seen eight summers, and cannot well make the journey alone. I would fetch the boy myself, but I cannot leave the village, for to do so would mean falling behind in my tasks. I did, however, give my word to Berahthraben's father that if aught were to happen to him, I would care for his son like he were my own.

The beasts succeeded in making off with most of the caravan's baggage, leaving what they didn't take in ruin. The opo-opos, however, showed little interest in the \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03Necrologos\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03, and the extent of their damage to the tome was limited to a portion ripped from the binding during the struggle\xe2\x94\x80the pages in question belonging to a chapter on voidsent.

Not only did milord see the manors built and the palms planted, but the beaches cleared of all manner of sea creature so that the people here might live out their lives in peace. The creatures, however, do not share Master Gegeruju's sentiments when it comes to who now claims dominion over this slice of paradise, and are constantly attempting their return.

The Lalafell claims to know naught regarding whence the tome came or how it happened to make its way in with his shipment, but ensures Mealvaan's Gate that he unbound and disposed of the book promptly.

As he tells it, a coeurl three times his size leapt down from a tree and began attacking him. Thankfully he remembered the knife I always have him carry, and used it to drive the beast back. Once there was enough distance betwixt the two, my son made his escape...but not before suffering injuries which will keep him from his duties for nigh on a full moon.

It seems the fighting with the kobolds of O'Ghomoro has hit a fever pitch, and not a day goes by when a poor man doesn't come back from the front lines needing an arm or leg removed. It's at these times my wine is most sought after, not only for dulling the senses of the amputee, but for cleaning the wound once the deed has been done. I can see that the bottles make it to the camp unscathed, but I need someone to see that I stay unscathed in the process.	0.8	0	0	178	0	3629068	4249265	69	1	1	0	216	216	75	0	32	80011	65658	110057	35	14	20	1	34	4	41	5	6
635	Appetite for Abduction	It is said that a goobbue eats up to three times its weight each day, and with some of the larger ones weighing upwards of three hundred stone, that equates to a great deal of prey, whether it be animal, vegetable, or mineral. The farmers and shepherds of eastern La Noscea have already begun complaining of missing crops and livestock, and, with the way things are going, it is only a matter of time before there arise complaints of missing children and elderly. The Yellowjackets seek assistance from adventurers in baiting goobbues with pelican meat and slaying the ones who bite.	0.8	0	0	178	0	3629068	3629769	57	1	1	0	216	216	75	0	32	80011	65659	110057	35	14	20	1	34	4	9	4	2
636	Now We're Even	These attacks are hurting business. Caravans roll armed to the teeth, suppliers lose flocks left and right, and warm-blooded outlanders still demand we keep to their soft schedule. Damn wolves owe us, is the way I look at it. You hunt 'em and skin 'em, and I'll see to their next life as winter coats.	0.8	0	0	179	0	3643001	3631239	125	1	2	0	385	385	75	0	63	80012	65660	110059	35	14	20	1	34	4	10	5	6
637	Have a Nice Trip	The Holy See of Ishgard bids you find a pie-eyed thing that lurks in the snow, glutted with herbs that bring false visions. Try as we might, a creature so loathsome to the godly is all but invisible to us. You, however, have no such problem. Use the disembodied claw of a napalm to thaw the abetting snow.	0.8	0	0	179	0	3643001	3631242	126	1	2	0	385	385	75	0	63	80012	65661	110059	35	14	20	1	34	4	13	5	6
638	Necrologos: Cinerary Rite	A servant of Ishgard has failed in his duties. Whilst putting the forbidden tome \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03Necrologos\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 to the sacred torch, he allowed the wind to snatch the charred leaves.

639	Meat and Bleat	The world's on its arse since the Calamity. One of our suppliers lost a flock of karakul\xe2\x94\x80to the wolves, he thought. Turns out it was some sly ogres.

641	Cower to the People	The maw of the dragon is nothing compared to a hundred thousand hungry mouths. The Holy See fears famine more than any other enemy, for it knows that naught will save it should the people rise against their masters.

642	Saving Bessy	A pair of foul things tried to get at our Bessy this morning. The more worldly among us named them red aevis, minions of the dragon horde. For their crime, they must be killed posthaste. Bessy is our sheep\xe2\x94\x80a dear friend to the Observatorium as well as the source of all our milk and curd.

645	Don't Forget to Cry	The demonic balor have made a desert of the route where fresh water wagons used to ply their trade.

646	Circling the Ceruleum	No matter how well protected the refinery itself may be, if we lose the road, we lose access to ceruleum.

674	Waking Wood	In addition to the mass destruction it wrought, the Calamity was also a catalyst for dramatic change within the Twelveswood's natural order. As habitats were altered, so too were behavior patterns of the forest's creatures, the treants being no exception. Since the inception of the Seventh Umbral Era, an increasing number of once-dormant oaks and maples have suddenly risen from the soil, striking fear into the smallholders who cultivate the lands outside of Gridania. To determine the reasons behind this mass awakening, the Greatloam Growery seeks able-bodied botanists to bring back samples of the local foliage.	5	0	0	213	0	2648030	3804097	23	3	2	1	90	90	85	0	54	80012	131080	110012	1	67	20	1	18	4	14	5	6
675	East Bank Story	The flames of the Calamity claimed large swaths of the primeval forest surrounding Gridania. Recognizing the importance of helping the Twelveswood and her kindred spirits recover, the Seedseers launched a large-scale reforestation effort, which began even before the rebuilding of the city-state. To ensure that the trees planted during that effort are growing properly and without disease, the Greatloam Growery conducts periodic studies of the young foliage, and seeks eager botanists to travel to the east bank of the Central Shroud river known as the West Vein and collect samples.	5	0	0	213	0	2648030	3804098	23	3	2	1	90	90	85	0	54	80012	131081	110012	1	67	20	1	18	4	14	5	6
676	We Couldn't Start the Fire	Though fire shards and crystals have essentially removed the need for cooking over an open flame, the Order of the Twin Adder wants to ensure that its members are prepared for the worst, and this includes situations in which crystal supplies may be low. This is why all new recruits to the Grand Company are required to heat their meals the old-fashioned way\xe2\x94\x80with a flint and some kindling. The Gods' Quiver, the guild in charge of Twin Adder training, will pay a substantial fee to botanists who are willing to chop wood and deliver it to the barracks.	5	0	0	213	0	2648030	3804099	21	3	2	1	90	90	85	0	54	80012	131082	110012	1	67	20	1	18	4	29	5	6
677	Lovely Latex	The alchemists of Frondale's Phrontistery in Ul'dah have placed an order with the Greatloam Growery for a sizable shipment of latex. They have, however, specified that for the experiments they plan on conducting, the product must be of the utmost purity, and have threatened to take their business elsewhere if it is anything less. The Botanists' Guild is seeking volunteers willing to collect the highest-quality, uncontaminated latex, and is offering a fair price for each delivery.	5	0	0	213	0	2648030	3810606	23	3	2	1	90	90	85	0	54	80012	131083	110012	1	67	20	1	18	4	29	5	6
678	Let the Sun Shine In	To see that sufficient sunlight reaches the tiny saplings which grow underneath the Twelveswood's majestic canopy, it is oft necessary to thin the forest of larger trees. The Botanists' Guild seeks those skilled with a hatchet to journey into the Central Shroud and assist with the effort.	20	0	0	214	0	2648030	3812135	22	3	2	1	90	90	85	0	54	80012	131084	110013	5	67	20	1	18	4	14	5	6
679	If a Tree Falls	Scattered throughout the Twelveswood, there stand trees so tall that they are thought to be the pillars which support the heavens, so ancient that they were giants when the first Elezen arrived in Eorzea thousands of summers past. It is even written that the snead of the scythe wielded by the goddess Nophica Herself was carved from one of these hoary sentinels. They are the silent protectors of the forest, the spirits residing deep within their hearts helping to maintain balance within the region. If even one were to fall, it could spell devastation. This is why the  Botanists' Guild takes regular samples from the roots of these trees to determine if they have been afflicted by any manner of sickness or blight.	20	0	0	214	0	2648030	3812136	23	3	2	1	90	90	85	0	54	80012	131085	110013	5	67	20	1	18	4	14	5	6
680	Evil Seeds	In one season, a single ochu can produce over a hundred seeds, which, as the creature makes its way through the forest, are oft caught on the moss growing on tree trunks. If left to germinate, the seeds give rise to microchus\xe2\x94\x80a vile plant which has the tendency to sap the soil of its nutrients, leaving little to none for the other foliage. To keep the microchu population in check, the Greatloam Growery seeks botanists to search mossy trees for these seeds and bring them back to the guild for proper disposal.	20	0	0	214	0	2648030	3812138	22	3	2	1	90	90	85	0	54	80012	131086	110013	5	67	20	1	18	4	29	5	6
681	No Bark, All Bite	Several varieties of funguar are known to release their spores directly onto the bark of wounded trees, so that the spores may take hold quicker. Unfortunately, this often results in the wound spreading, eventually leading to the death of the host plant. The Greatloam Growery seeks skilled botanists to travel into the forest and seek out trees that show blotchy patches of white\xe2\x94\x80a telltale sign that they have been infected with the funguar spores\xe2\x94\x80and use their hatchets to carefully remove the affected area.	20	0	0	214	0	2648030	3812139	22	3	2	1	90	90	85	0	54	80012	131087	110013	5	67	20	1	18	4	15	5	6
682	A Chest of Nuts	Once found throughout the Twelveswood, wild Gridanian chestnuts have become an increasing rarity due to the loss of a majority of the region's chestnut trees to Calamity-induced wildfires. The trees that were replanted after the fires have only begun to mature and bear fruit, and still require a great deal of tending before they will be ready for harvesting. To determine the amount and type of care required, close examination of the chestnuts is necessary, and therefore the Greatloam Growery is actively seeking botanists to visit the chestnut grove near Galvanth's Spire and retrieve an amount upon which a suitable hypothesis can be built.	40	0	0	215	0	1672782	3812140	23	3	2	1	94	94	85	0	54	80012	131088	110014	10	67	20	1	18	4	14	5	6
683	West Bank Story	The flames of the Calamity claimed large swaths of the primeval forest surrounding Gridania. Recognizing the importance of helping the Twelveswood and her kindred spirits recover, the Seedseers launched a large-scale reforestation effort, which began even before the rebuilding of the city-state. To ensure that the trees planted during that effort are growing properly and without disease, the Greatloam Growery conducts periodic studies of the young foliage, and seeks eager botanists to travel to the west bank of the Central Shroud river known as the West Vein and collect samples.	40	0	0	215	0	1672782	3812142	23	3	2	1	94	94	85	0	54	80012	131089	110014	10	67	20	1	18	4	14	5	6
684	Digging Deep	By nature, chocobos are excellent diggers and, when properly trained, can be used to unearth mushrooms, tubers, or sometimes even hidden treasure. When left unattended, however, chocobos will instinctively claw and peck away at the ground\xe2\x94\x80especially near partially buried items such as fence posts. When this occurs, the birds can escape their corrals, costing the owners thousands of gil in retrieval costs. One way to prevent this type of mishap is by burying fence posts deep into the soil. The only requirement here being that the posts be of a certain height so that once they are set, the chocobos won't be able to leap over them, let alone dig them up. Moogle's Gift Mounts will generously reward any adventurer with the skill to procure logs which will suit their needs.	40	0	0	215	0	1672782	3812151	28	3	2	1	94	94	85	0	54	80012	131090	110014	10	67	20	1	18	4	29	5	6
685	The Heart of the Hedge	Hedgetrees play an important role in the forest by helping to maintain the protective barrier which shields the Twelveswood from harm. Should the trees become damaged, the forest would find itself more susceptible to outside danger. One manner of threat to these guardians is roselet seeds, which get lodged in pockets of soil that gather on a Hedgetree's trunk or limbs. Once sprouted, the roselet saplings will send a taproot deep into the tree's core, where it will divert the flow of nutrients to its own body. In severe cases, this can result in the withering of large branches. To ensure this does not happen, the Botanists' Guild seeks volunteers to travel to nearby Hedgetrees and examine the bark for seeds, removing any they find.	40	0	0	215	0	1672782	3812153	29	3	2	1	94	94	85	0	54	80012	131091	110014	10	67	20	1	18	4	25	5	6
686	The Quick and the Dead	As its name implies, quickweed is a swift-growing plant that, in a matter of days, can cover an entire field if left untouched. Farmers and smallholders especially despise the plant, as it quickly drains even the richest soil of its nutrients, dooming crops for an entire season. The damage, however, is not merely limited to farmsteads. Quickweed can also drain the life of the forest's guardians\xe2\x94\x80the Hedgetrees. This cannot be allowed to happen, and so the Botanists' Guild is offering good coin to all those who will assist in the eradication of this invasive plant.	40	0	0	216	0	1646078	3746651	29	3	2	1	107	107	85	0	55	80012	131092	110015	15	67	20	1	18	4	14	5	6
687	Maple Stories	There isn't a soul in the Twelveswood who hasn't heard of my amazing mead, and while I have no plans to cease its golden flow, I'd be lying if I didn't admit to growing weary of doing the same thing, day in and day out. Which is why I've decided to try my hand at something different, if not to simply break the monotony. And what is that something, you ask? Why, use my mead-making knowledge to brew an even sweeter blend! But this time, instead of the usual honey, I plan on using maple sap! The only problem is, as a lifelong beekeeper, I haven't the foggiest idea of how to get the sap from the tree, which is why I need the help of skilled botanists. Bring me the maple sap I need, and I'll see that you are rewarded most handsomely!	46	0	0	216	0	1646078	3746653	32	3	2	1	107	107	85	0	55	80012	131093	110015	15	67	20	1	18	4	29	5	6
688	Never Strikes Twice	It has been recently discovered that sylphs are branding trees with what appears to be the mark of the primal Ramuh. While the significance of these marks is still not fully understood, it is unlikely that the tribe's intentions are good, and therefore the Wood Wailers seek assistance from local adventurers in the removal of the brands.	40	0	0	216	0	1646078	3746652	30	3	2	1	107	107	85	0	55	80012	131094	110015	15	67	20	1	18	4	29	5	6
689	Briar in the Hole	The past several moons have seen a marked increase in the number of violent creatures prowling the area immediately to the north of the Hawthorne Hut. Homestead owner Rolfe Hawthorne believes that the recent influx of beasts might be attributed to an abundance of new forage, such as the giant briars, introduced to the region after the Calamity, and is seeking botanists to survey the nearby landscape for evidence to support his theory.	40	0	0	216	0	1646078	3746657	34	3	2	1	107	107	85	0	55	80012	131095	110015	15	67	20	1	18	4	25	5	6
690	Nowhere to Slide	The Calamity saw the toppling of countless scores of the Twelveswood's trees. And now, with fewer roots to keep the soil in place, not a week goes by when mud- and landslides do not rip large chunks of earth from the hillsides and deposit them across roads\xe2\x94\x80roads leading to important places of commerce such as Buscarron's Druthers. To try and prevent the next slide before it hits, alehouse proprietor Buscarron Strongarm seeks skilled botanists to examine the root system in the area around his establishment and report anything that might be cause for concern.	40	0	0	217	0	2257020	3804003	31	3	2	1	129	129	85	0	56	80012	131096	110016	20	67	20	1	18	4	14	5	6
691	Shaken, Not Stirred	With trade routes open again, my establishment is oft frequented by merchants and caravans hailing from the deserts of Thanalan, where they prefer their drinks flavored with all manner of sweet fruit and herbs. Why anyone would spoil a fine cup of mead with a foul weed plucked from the underbrush is beyond me, but if it means a few extra coins in my coffer, I'm willing to oblige. And, as such, I'm always looking to purchase high-quality galago mint from anyone willing to sell.	40	0	0	217	0	2257020	3804004	31	3	2	1	129	129	85	0	56	80012	131097	110016	20	67	20	1	18	4	29	5	6
692	Just the Artifacts, Madam	In the countless generations since the fall of Gelmorra, the Twelveswood has reclaimed much of the ancient city, so to uncover the civilization's lost secrets, a little digging is ofttimes necessary. The land around Issom-Har is known to yield a variety of Gelmorran artifacts such as coins and potsherds which have become tangled in the roots of giant trees. While of no value to most, these relics of a past age are the subject of my ongoing studies into Gridania's history, and I will pay a fair price for any items you may find.	40	0	0	217	0	2257020	3804005	43	3	2	1	129	129	85	0	56	80012	131098	110016	20	67	20	1	18	4	29	5	6
693	Fueling the Flames	When it comes to deciding who's the fastest woodcutter in the forest, Buscarron's Druthers has more than a few times become the proving grounds for quick-tempered lads with hatchets on their backs and a bit too much ale in their bellies. After growing weary of having to replace my poor establishment's furnishings following every bout, I proposed that the hot-headed cutters take their pissing contest to the trees, promising a hefty reward to whoever brought back the most firewood. I certainly don't see aught wrong with a little friendly competition, as long as it keeps my cookfires hot while keeping the hall spruce.	40	0	0	217	0	2257020	3804006	31	3	2	1	129	129	85	0	56	80012	131099	110016	20	67	20	1	18	4	15	5	6
694	Over the Underbrush	Despite the efforts of her residents to maintain the grounds, the hamlet of Quarrymill is constantly overrun with quick-growing weeds and thicket.

We do this not only to honor the traditions of our clan, but to also let the gods know that we are prepared to serve them as warriors in the afterlife, should we fall at the hands of our enemies. The paint we use is taken from the inedible red berries of a herb known as 'soldier's sore' that can be found growing in the South Shroud.

696	Appleanche	The skies have been kind to the Twelveswood's orchards, the result being apple yields almost twice the size they were but a year ago. There is so much fruit on the trees, in fact, that the local farmers do not have the capacity to gather it all before it falls from the trees and becomes bruised and riddled with worms. To see that all the apples make it to market, the Greatloam Growery is seeking botanists to assist in this season's harvest.	40	0	0	218	0	2257020	3803999	23	3	2	1	129	129	85	0	56	80012	131102	110017	25	67	20	1	18	4	15	5	6
697	Mushroom Gobblin'	Ever since the return of goblins to the Twelveswood, strange mushrooms have been spotted sprouting from the trunks of trees throughout the forest. The Greatloam Growery has yet to determine whether or not this new species of seedkin is harmful to its hosts, and therefore requires several samples on which it may conduct its tests. A reward has been set aside for all botanists who are able to lend their services to the procurement of these mushrooms for the guild.	46	0	0	218	0	2257020	3804000	45	3	2	1	129	129	85	0	56	80012	131103	110017	25	67	20	1	18	4	15	5	6
698	The Palm in Your Hand	It appears that the sago palms that Lalafellin tycoon Gegeruju planted five summers ago in Bloodshore to remind him of his summer home in the Cieldalaes are not only pleasant to look upon, but can also be quite delicious...or at least according to one of my new chefs who is also from the islands. According to her, the pith which is found within the tree's thick trunk can be boiled down into a starchy paste which is high in energy. I wish to try this peculiar food myself, and require several fresh samples.	51	0	0	219	0	3999029	4031135	76	3	1	1	206	206	85	0	32	80011	131104	110039	30	67	20	1	18	4	14	5	6

700	Bleeding Them Dry	There is no better customer than an elderly Ul'dahn. Forget what you've heard about the wonders of the afterlife, these well-to-dos seek only to extend their stay in Nald's realm that they might revel in its pleasures. For them, possession is power, money is never an object, and senility sees that they keep coming back for more. Take, for example, Wanderer's Blood. As useless as snake oil, and twice as foul, but its rarity has transformed it into a must-have item here in Costa del Sol. And when there is demand, it is only natural to provide a supply. If you are willing to assist my establishment in gathering the Oschon roselle calyces needed to give the tincture its color, I would be more than happy to give you a cut of my profits.	45	0	0	219	0	3999029	4031137	65	3	1	1	206	206	85	0	32	80011	131106	110039	30	67	20	1	18	4	15	5	6

Bah, a man what needs his humours calmed is a man what's not worth living, I say. On the other hand, I run me a business, and what good's a business if it won't see to the demands of its patrons.

Only a rock sample will tell.	20	0	0	224	0	3958072	4031114	74	2	3	1	263	263	84	0	42	80013	131125	110043	5	67	20	1	17	4	14	5	6
720	Pipikkuli's Ship Comes In	Rumors race like wildfire from tavern to tavern: Pipikkuli, the penniless rover, has found a deposit of Nashachite, one of the rarest treasures of the land. Uncharacteristically moneyed and now rather inappropriately named, Pipikkuli the Poor is hiring willing miners to excavate the gem.	20	0	0	224	0	3958072	4031115	77	2	3	1	263	263	84	0	42	80013	131126	110043	5	67	20	1	17	4	29	5	6
721	I Don't Zinc It's a Coincidence	An Amajina & Sons prospector found a goodly seam of zinc, but the men consider the spot cursed following a spate of minor\xe2\x94\x80trifling, really\xe2\x94\x80accidents involving a honeyed dormouse, bootlace and a pickaxe, in that order.

722	Break It Up	The past is always with us\xe2\x94\x80rather inconveniently, in the case of an ancient temple cluttering the future site of a reservoir. Skilled hands are needed to dismantle this archaeological treasure. With a bit of luck, it can be sold to some outland museum to offset the cost of its own unbuilding.	40	0	0	225	0	2540071	4031123	78	2	3	1	271	271	84	0	42	80013	131128	110045	10	67	20	1	17	4	14	5	6
723	That's Why They Call It Fool's Gold	Pipikkuli the Poor has once again returned to his natural state\xe2\x94\x80a head full of fancy and a pocket full of holes. His intuition tells him that there's gold in Horizon's Edge, but none will listen after eight other intuitions this month failed to yield so much as a brass tack.	40	0	0	225	0	2540071	4031124	77	2	3	1	271	271	84	0	42	80013	131129	110045	10	67	20	1	17	4	14	5	6
724	It Peiste to Listen	Aurumheart Aewuld is looking a mite twitchier than usual. The peistes are in molt, and the thought of all that gossamer hide fluttering among the rocks is enough to drive the goldsmith to distraction. \xe2\x80\x9cLike warm silk,\xe2\x80\x9d he has been overheard murmuring.

725	We Do This the Hard Way	Some hard questions are being asked regarding the hardness of the rock as Amajina & Sons prepare to carve an adit from Nophica's Wells straight into Copperbell Mines. If the country rock cannot hold, it may cost lives \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03and\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 limbs\xe2\x94\x80or worse yet, prove a disprofit to the bottom line. 	40	0	0	225	0	2540071	4031127	73	2	3	1	271	271	84	0	42	80013	131131	110045	10	67	20	1	17	4	25	5	6
726	A Man's Gotta Dream	They say myths are the world's dreams and dreams are one man's myths. When Pipikkuli dreams, he speaks the fable we know by heart\xe2\x94\x80of a common man with uncommon fate, of lonely pursuits that are never in vain. Seek you his mythril, for believe we all must that there is more truth in myth than lies.	40	0	0	226	0	2540213	4031128	77	2	3	1	300	300	84	0	44	80013	131132	110046	15	67	20	1	17	4	14	5	6
727	Earth Sprites Are Easy	Sprite-based products enjoy a healthy following, and never more so than since the Calamity. Rocks from areas favored by earth sprites are popular as \xe2\x80\x9ccompanion cobbles,\xe2\x80\x9d oversized amulets of a sort.

728	Eiderdown for Eidolons	They say the dead sleep well in the lichyard of Saint Adama Landama, with earth below and tombstone above. It is one of the duties of the church to keep the ground consecrated and new stones on the ready, for if the sleepers should wake, none shall hear again the bells of Saint Adama Landama.	40	0	0	226	0	2540213	4031130	80	2	3	1	300	300	84	0	44	80013	131134	110046	15	67	20	1	17	4	29	5	6
729	The Doom that Came to Belah'dia	It draws breath still, the Invisible City, though the time of Belah'dia is long past. Do you not hear the stones that shroud the ruins, hear them turning? Click-click-click like a restless dog pacing its master's chamber floor. Bring them away, I beg you, thin the herd.

730	Look How They Shine for You	Pipikkuli, Pipikkuli. From rags to riches, and always rags again. They call him a rolling stone, a wandering fool\xe2\x94\x80and sometimes, the diviner of metals. His latest reverie has him convinced of gold sands in the river, in the southern Twelveswood.

731	Elemental Housekeeping	Of overground traces of Gelmorra, few remain to disturb the order of the forest, yet occasional ruins are still found that must needs be removed.

732	Location, Location, Location	For half a thousand years, the ruins of Gelmorra have served as a necropolis, but the Calamity has Gridanians eyeing the underground city and murmuring about a new kind of curb appeal\xe2\x94\x80curbing the chances of being flattened by a meteor, to be exact. Large slabs are sought for a little renovation.	40	0	0	227	0	2257020	4031102	43	2	2	1	129	129	84	0	56	80012	131138	110040	20	67	20	1	17	4	29	5	6

Brick is a handsome enough material, but if I had my druthers\xe2\x94\x80and you know I always do\xe2\x94\x80nothing strikes me as spruce as a wall of good, flat stones.

734	Fool Me Twice	You sometimes wonder about Pipikkuli. Where is he from? What does he do with his occasional windfall? Is he in fact feigning witlessness?

735	Can't Start a Fire	In one of the lesser effects of the Calamity, the flint quarry in the Twelveswood has been devastated, the hard stone exploded to shards by the heat. For breweries as large as the one in the Mun-Tuy Cellars, with dozens of flintlock burners, the lack has grown too toilsome to ignore.	46	0	0	228	0	2257020	4031105	75	2	2	1	129	129	84	0	56	80012	131141	110041	25	67	20	1	17	4	29	5	6
736	Tag, You're It	Some Duskwight has stolen up to the fortification of Quarrymill and scratched remarks most uncalled for upon it.

737	Baby, Light My Way	Darker are the nights in Quarrymill since the Calamity, without the great lanterns to swaddle the pine-pitch flames within their granite folds. The Wood Wailers would pay a fair price for quality stone, for gil saved in poultices for twisted ankles alone would pay for it.	40	0	0	228	0	2257020	4031107	35	2	2	1	129	129	84	0	56	80012	131143	110041	25	67	20	1	17	4	15	5	6
738	I Kidd You Not	Not all of Pipikkuli's fevered notions arise from the depth of sleep\xe2\x94\x80or the depth of a wine flagon, as some less charitable souls would insist\xe2\x94\x80but from the vaporing of braggarts and broken men.

739	That's What the Money Is For	Contrary to popular belief, war is more often won with gil rather than will. Gil buys concessions for iron ore and pays miners. Will, though a fine thing, is a metal untested in most who profess to have it in abundance. Not persuaded? I care not.

747	Brother in Arms	House Fortemps owes the wyrms a debt of fire. A dragoon I loved well, the first among us, fell at the Stone Vigil. We buried him in armor; there was no separating him from it.

748	Breach and Build	It is not a question of if we retake the Stone Vigil, but when. As such, we must consider the repairs to be made. The outer defenses we will breach here and here.

749	Not Losing Our Heads This Time	The Stone Vigil will be won by solving deadly puzzles we could not at the last battle.

763	Just Add Water	Old women jest that tiger cod is like first love: better dried and salted than fresh. A great many things have been thus compared to the first tenderness of the heart, but surely this is one of the best\xe2\x94\x80snowy flakes of delicate sea-flesh, merely awaiting a soak to come alive again.	1	7744	100	186	0	4258097	0	142	4	1	0	218	218	86	0	33	80011	917994	110076	10	14	0	1	19	0	42	5	6
764	Brain Candy	Foods too rich for other palates are often those most sought out by the Qiqirn. Pebble crabs have unusually large brains\xe2\x94\x80best not to reflect too deeply upon what that means\xe2\x94\x80and the Qiqirn bite into them like ripe plums after supping heartily on the rest of the shellfish.	1	2410	100	205	0	4258097	0	142	4	1	0	218	218	86	0	33	80011	917995	110076	10	14	0	1	19	0	30	5	6
765	The Fertile Incandescent	The lands are lean near the sea, and every few seasons, custom calls for the fields to be feasted. Called \xe2\x80\x9csilvering the soil,\xe2\x80\x9d the field is covered in harbor herring through the night so that sunrise finds it too bright to look upon. The fish are plowed under by noon, and rich grows the soil.	1	2022	100	205	0	4258097	0	142	4	1	0	218	218	86	0	33	80011	917996	110076	10	14	0	1	19	0	30	5	6

I've got me a trade now, though, and 'tain't pretties I need today but oysters what taverns can stew up in great cauldrons, or serve fresh on th' shell with salt an' whisky.

767	The Deepest Cut	Good eatin', razor clams, but they sure are sharp! I sliced me feet up something bad once. Didn't go home till the cut stopped bleedin' on account of I was afraid of a strappin'. But of course, Da beat me for bein' late with water for his stills.

770	Sounds Fishy to Me	They keep fish as ornaments, did you know about this? It's absolutely mad, the habits of these Lominsans. Who wants that high stink in their home, is what I was thinking, and well, it turns out the fish are supposed to be alive. Well! I'm a hunter, not a trapper, thank you very much.	1	12218	200	188	0	4258347	0	144	4	2	0	129	129	86	0	56	80012	918001	110071	20	14	0	1	19	0	42	5	6
771	The Long and the Shortcrust	You know the only good fish to eat? Eels. I absolutely adore eel pie\xe2\x94\x80it's as good as anything you'll find on land. The only thing wrong with them is that before they're chopped up and put in pies they look\xe2\x94\x80yes, they do, they really do\xe2\x94\x80like snakes.

772	Food Chain Reaction	I thought a fish farm might be a good idea, but surprise, surprise, there was something I didn't know. The faerie bass I put in\xe2\x94\x80the entire flock or lesson or whatever you call them\xe2\x94\x80are eating the anchovies.

773	Blind Ambition	Can you believe the nerve, this goblin fisherman said I wouldn't be able to outfish him even if he were blindfolded! Well, I took the bet, of course! We Keepers of the Moon do not take insults lying down, especially if they're true! Since he won't be able to see a thing, you can prove him wrong.	1	6109	200	207	0	4258347	0	144	4	2	0	129	129	86	0	56	80012	918004	110071	20	14	0	1	19	0	30	5	6
774	A Shocking Soiree	I don't see how they can snicker at Ul'dahns considering what passes for amusement in Limsa. Did you know about these parties where people hold electric eels whilst clasping hands? They call them fish fries, haha.

Well, I can't very well disappoint her, I'm her hero!

776	Fishing 101	You know, I figured out that my life would be so much easier if I could actually fish well. I'd be able to stop all this fibbing, for one. There's no substitute for practice, so I guess you can tell everyone Daca Jinjahl's gone fishin'! Oh, could you get me a few dark bass so I can make bait?	1	9262	250	208	0	4258347	0	144	4	2	0	129	129	86	0	56	80012	918007	110072	25	14	0	1	19	0	30	5	6
777	The Truth Will Set You Free	I was at the Sanctum of the Twelve, and ended up confessing all\xe2\x94\x80that I'd been hiring adventurers to catch my fish for me. It's utterly mad, but it felt so good to come clean. I mean, she was a gardener not a cleric, but still. And she wants me to find ornamentals for their pond. An honest job!	1	9885	250	208	0	4258347	0	144	4	2	0	129	129	86	0	56	80012	918008	110072	25	14	0	1	19	0	30	5	6
778	A Recipe for Disaster	I am in the employ of Master Gegeruju. You've no doubt heard of his business successes and personal...excesses. A certain young person has become a fixture on his arm of late, and this special friend has it in her rather untenanted mind to cook for him. I have been tasked with procuring ingredients.	1	31098	300	190	0	4258923	0	145	4	1	0	206	206	86	0	32	80011	918009	110075	30	14	0	1	19	0	42	5	6
779	Just Call Me Late for Dinner	Master Gegeruju's new favorite is less of a culinarian than was advertised. The amount of food she has rendered inedible is as remarkable as the diversity of their manner of destruction. Still, the show must go on\xe2\x94\x80herring this time. They are slated to die a vinegary death in a marinade attempt.	1	30282	300	190	0	4258923	0	145	4	1	0	206	206	86	0	32	80011	918010	110075	30	14	0	1	19	0	42	5	6
780	Kitchen Nightmares No More	Well, I cannot deny that there is great relief among the household. The young person will not set foot in the kitchen again, and we shall finally see breakfast, lunch, and dinner on the table rather than charred onto pans and plastered on the ceiling. A celebration is in order, I believe.	1	14725	300	209	0	4258923	0	145	4	1	0	206	206	86	0	32	80011	918011	110075	30	14	0	1	19	0	30	5	6
781	The Blue Period	If she cannot have the kitchen, Master Gegeruju's special friend must have her atelier. A sultana's ransom in paint and canvas is a small price to pay, and on that, the entire household is in agreement. However, pigment-yielding sea pickles being plenteous, some small economizing is in order.	1	14725	300	209	0	4258923	0	145	4	1	0	206	206	86	0	32	80011	918012	110075	30	14	0	1	19	0	30	5	6
782	The Perks of Politics	Of late, the Observatorium has been playing host to an increasing number of visitors from the Holy See. While puzzled by these inspection tours that see little and hear much, the astrologians are pleased to have the coin for meals that nourish rather than punish. The fish course is yours to purvey.	1	39900	350	191	0	4258781	0	146	4	2	0	385	385	86	0	63	80012	918013	110078	35	14	0	1	19	0	42	5	6
783	Hands off Our Fish	When the moon waxes full, troutflesh grows sweet. Alas, raccoons know this as well as any fisherman, and they will have their clever paws in the water. The Twelve surely meant crimson trout to pass from this life gazing cross-eyed upon our hooks, not the bewhiskered snouts of those washers of sin. 	1	53414	350	191	0	4258781	0	146	4	2	0	385	385	86	0	63	80012	918014	110078	35	14	0	1	19	0	42	5	6
784	Fry Me a River	It is the annual custom of the Confraternity of Fisherfolk to release fry into those waters where we make our livelihood, to give where we have taken. Alas, an unaccountable surge in the number of giant bass threatens our precious babes. Cull the aggressors with all the fury of a mother roused.	1	21057	350	210	0	4258781	0	146	4	2	0	385	385	86	0	63	80012	918015	110078	35	14	0	1	19	0	30	5	6
785	Gathering Light	Glass is the lesser of the lenses used by the astrologians. The other resides in the mind\xe2\x94\x80a poor thing in most men, too cracked and flawed to see much that is not murky. The few with the gift enter the Observatorium, and with the essence of marimo is that phrenic lens ground and furbished.	1	19950	350	210	0	4258781	0	146	4	2	0	385	385	86	0	63	80012	918016	110078	35	14	0	1	19	0	30	5	6
786	Empire Builder	Before the Calamity, the lakes were as a metropolis teeming with fish noble and common, its streets paved with gold. But the chill has made hamlets of these cities and I toil to fill the void, releasing fry fit for colder climes.

787	Laird of the Lakes	I was but a simple fisher before the Calamity, content to let nature provide for me. But in changing times, only changemakers may flourish, or indeed survive. I am become the keeper of these waters; I know the needs of each lake I seed. It is time to cull the pikes\xe2\x94\x80they grow overlarge.	1	65144	400	192	0	4258782	0	147	4	2	0	402	402	86	0	63	80012	918018	110079	40	14	0	1	19	0	42	5	6
788	Make a Fish	It is a curious fact that some fish may live in waters salty and fresh. The Lominsan smelt I seeded here in the highland lake have thriven, and folk scarce remember that the Abalathian smelt sprang from the mind of Louviaune. They have spawned well again, and we may expect an excellent haul.	1	26707	400	211	0	4258782	0	147	4	2	0	402	402	86	0	63	80012	918019	110079	40	14	0	1	19	0	30	5	6

790	Putting the Zap on Nature	Certain electrical phenomena\xe2\x94\x80phenomena of a rather distressing nature\xe2\x94\x80suggest that the Allagan Empire may have created electric fish. Just think!

791	Awash in Evidence	The midden heap from the dig has produced much fishbone, the reconstruction of which suggests a bass. If life in the lake has changed so little over the centuries, Silvertear could well be the mythical \xe2\x80\x9cBathtub of the Twelve.\xe2\x80\x9d We must compare the bones to a modern bass, looking well before we leap.	1	71040	450	193	0	4258842	0	148	4	3	0	416	416	86	0	67	80013	918022	110080	45	14	0	1	19	0	42	5	6

Nobody else can abide the Amalj'aa delicacy\xe2\x94\x80in fact, nobody else can digest it\xe2\x94\x80but he makes a quick and noisy meal out of them, creating a shell mound for future naturalists to draw erroneous conclusions from. 	1	32572	450	212	0	4258842	0	148	4	3	0	416	416	86	0	67	80013	918023	110080	45	14	0	1	19	0	30	5	6

794	Don't Touch Our Stuff	A cowardly attack was made on a supply party en route to the Moraby Drydocks.

Stage a gaudy demon hunt, that you may draw the lizards' attention to the other side of the ridge and allay their suspicion.	0.8	0	0	1	0	4103464	3446703	108	18	3	0	300	300	104	0	44	80013	196628	110054	20	14	5	1	34	4	21	3	6
804	Blood in the Water	There are shape-shifters about, maddening the wild beasts among whom they travel. Caravans have seen screaming sheep, wool dripping crimson and horns crusted black, reel into oases to foul the water with their corruption. Root out the shapeshifters and afford them neither ruth nor rage.\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03(Begin by surprising an earth sprite with a /poke, then slay the glowing figure to acquire luminous crystals.

805	The Burning Reason	One of our desert snakes brings news of Mamanzo the Charred, he who literally burns to serve the primal Ifrit. His devotion is more than deliration to be abhorred; we fear that his acts of self-immolation will prove a contagion that brings other thaumaturges under Ifrit's thrall.

806	Of Mice and Demons	We the Knights of the Barracuda are taking command of Oschon's Torch to bolster the defenses of the Moraby Drydocks. Supply missions to the garrison there have been attacked one too many times, no doubt at the instigation of Qiqirn brigands who then make off with unguarded cargo.

807	Wrong and Rite	A group of Sahagin has come ashore in the cover of night, and a fell ritual is underway as we speak among the tall grass of Idle Hearts.

808	Double Dose of Impin'	Imps in the guise of beastkin are playing havoc with sentries. It is a matter of time before they are befuddled into doing harm to each other.

809	You're a Liar, Mansel Black	Twin-tongued Mansel, the dark thaumaturge of the Lambs of Dalamud, has finally surfaced.

810	Go with the Flow	Some deride us as the Candy Company, so false a color under which we sail. Under the guise of making maple syrup, we drain poison from a cult's secret copse of death apples.

811	Sylph Strands	Sylphs under the thrall of the primal Ramuh are raising a new fort, using brute strength to squeeze out sylphs friendly to us.

812	Blinded by the Wight	Nighttime patrols have proven hazardous of late, with many returning to camp hours\xe2\x94\x80sometimes days\xe2\x94\x80later with tales of snow-white hinds, roads that wind like curls of wood, and faithless constellations. Clearly, some infernal creature is in need of an escort back to hell.\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03(Begin by surprising a wind sprite with a /poke, then slay the glowing figure to acquire luminous crystals.

813	A Real Wingnut	Once a friend to the Order of the Twin Adder, Pannixia of the Woven Wing has turned against us and demands that other sylphs join her in this folly\xe2\x94\x80or perish in agony as her magicks consume them with exquisite slowness. She is too powerful a conjurer to have as a foe, and she refuses all offers of friendship.

815	Food for Thought	Many a chain has been broken by the Calamity, and the jagged ends draw blood. There have been fewer aldgoats and sheep about these parts since destruction rained down from above, and now we have reports of starving beastkin attacking caravans.

816	The Third Prize Is that You're Slain	No sooner than we slay a fire-starting imp and dispatch another dubbed the Grey Strangler do we receive word of an imp who takes the form of an aldgoat and bars the way of supply trains. While this places a distant third to arson and choking the life out of children, we feel that a consistent response is called for.\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03(Begin by surprising an earth sprite with a /poke, then slay the glowing figure to acquire luminous crystals.

817	A Heart Aflame	The serial fire-starter Margry Flintheart has been revealed as a devotee of the primal Ifrit. She has also been seen wielding dark tomes to summon voidsent.

818	Road Worriers	We the Knights of the Barracuda are taking command of road upkeep and repair, for bitter experience has taught us that what is overlooked in cobbles and struts may be paid in flesh and blood.

833	Fanning the Flames	You are bid to join the defense of a lookout post in the central highlands of Coerthas, where a bonfire burns night and day in vigilance against the scaled abomination that is the Ixal.

834	Fishing Off the Company Pier	Whoever takes food from the table of Ishgard deserves not a crumb of mercy, for the ignominy of hunger pains those proud dragoons far more than a lance through the gut.

839	Just Making an Observation	The Observatorium in the hinterlands of Coerthas is much troubled by beasts.

844	Dress for Aggress	Arrzaneth Ossuary warns of demons that walk in the guise of beastmen for some fell purpose.

845	Pick Your Poison	The Foreign Brigade has detained a merchant who sold a quantity of bane on the black market. He has admitted all, including the rendezvous point.

853	Yellow Is the New Black	Our friends in Ishgard have learned that the Yellow Serpents strike swift and true. So keenly do they seek our fangs and venom that they offer favored terms for chocobo export. An Ishgardian bird in hand is worth two in Vylbrand. Adventurers, be our venom in this thrust.

858	You Dropped Something	A supply convoy came under ambush by a band of giants. They managed to fight their way to safety, but some of the much-needed cargo lies unattended where it fell.

859	No Big Whoop	The knights of House Durendaire beg our help with voidsent in the guise of giants. Truly, these dragoons are made of strong metal. They have been mauled, maddened, frozen, starved, dropped, tripped, stripped, sliced, and the Twelve know what else.

878	The Unexpected Tourist	While the knights have warned them how treacherous the road may be, handfuls of civilians have begun to leave the cradle of Ishgard to travel into the reclaimed volatile lands around Falcon's Nest and the Anvil in order to lay wreaths and pay respects to the statue of Haldrath at the Pike. It presents quite the conundrum as the safety of those who choose to willingly step into the lair of ferocious monsters cannot be guaranteed, yet those devoted who listen to the calling of their hearts merit at least some form of courtesy. Ergo the knights are looking for those free of time and wanting of coin to slay any creatures in the vicinity that may try to attack unarmed civilians.	0.6	0	779	458	0	5581915	5887782	151	1	4	0	2204	2300	87	0	2200	80014	65735	110084	50	14	20	1	34	1	6	5	6
879	Don't Come Back	Praise be to Halone, for our knights have been saved by Her hand! The contingent had been caught in a blizzard, and as they rubbed their frostbitten hands together and steeled themselves for the end, a blessed creature loomed in their presence: the Last Yak, so named as the knights thought it the last thing they would ever see. But there is no doubt that Halone had sent Her blessed messenger to answer our prayers, for the beast allowed the freezing men to climb onto its back. As they clung to its warm, shaggy hide, it trudged through the biting winds and delivered the men to safety. While we are eternally in debt to the creature\xe2\x94\x80which in gratitude we fed such a feast of ale and bread\xe2\x94\x80the Last Yak must return to the herd whence it came.

881	We're So Above This (L)	While capable of dispatching a variety of threats, the Temple Knights have found themselves becoming somewhat overwhelmed by an influx of agitated predators hunting for food in the swaths of land between Falcon's Nest and the Anvil. It's preposterous for the chosen warriors of the realm to spend all day fending off hungry bears and yetis when the city's crumbled line of defense is in dire need of reconstruction.

885	Feathers Unsullied	Military chocobos grow to be fierce warriors in the like of their masters, yet neither man nor bird learns the art of fearlessness overnight. In the wild, chocobos develop the natural instinct to run from predators as chicks. Hence chocobos that are bred and groomed for service to the sword must enjoy a chickhood free of any fear from the trivial beasts in the fields so that larger, more frightening beasts can be gradually introduced in their adolescent training to evoke a fight\xe2\x94\x80not flight\xe2\x94\x80reaction.

A high priest of the Holy See traveled to the Chocobo Forest to visit the chocobo breeding grounds to give blessings to the hatchlings of reputable stock that had been chosen to become holy warriors of Ishgard. What should have been a revered event was ruined when a gang of barbarous imps anticipated the arrival and prepared a low-tied vine during the ritual of ground purification, tripping the poor man and causing him to fall into a nearby watering trough, his sanctity soaked to the very core. No sooner had he returned to the capital had I received a signed parchment requesting a \xe2\x80\x9ccleansing\xe2\x80\x9d of all dastardly voidkin in the area, an order to which I impart upon you with glee.

888	Scavenger Hunt (L)	One of the daft apprentices of Tailfeather told not a soul he was unsure in the ways of properly disposing of a deceased chocobo, and instead hid the carcass behind some brush for a fortnight. As you can imagine, the stench attracted large numbers of scavengers like fleas and hippocerfs looking to lap up the rancid meal.

These days, too many youngbloods sign up for the training to join our noble ranks without showing a shred of decent talent, hence I have decided to thin out the crop through a trial. If the men can identify and destroy the spots on targets wrapped in scaleskin, they may continue their training. If they fail, they are to relinquish their weapon and accept pursuit of a less virtuous craft.

896	Two Birds, One Culling	The Haillenarte contingents in Camp Cloudtop desire assistance in reducing aerial ambushes by tsanahales, which have recently found some success clawing out the eyes of those unfortunate knights assigned to patrol duty.

897	Don't Eat the Shrooms	Due to a number of troops left bedridden after supping on a stew seasoned with queerly spotted mushrooms, the Rose Knights are looking for an extra pair of eyes to survey positions in the Sea of Clouds and neutralize any threats bearing claws or jaws.

899	Just Washed (L)	In addition to the physical threat posed by their sharp talons and barbed beaks, the winged beasts that roost in Camp Cloudtop pose a grave threat to the Rose Knights' reputation. Armor spotted in cloudkin droppings rather than gore is looked upon as an embarrassment (and takes great pains to clean). The Rose Knights would like to exterminate the beasts altogether and call for a cloudkin-slayer that can lure them out with gastornis breasts and promptly give them what for.	2.4	0	9538	466	0	5581915	5891107	151	1	4	0	2116	2300	87	0	2100	80014	65756	110088	56	14	20	10	34	1	9	2	6

However, House Haillenarte's depleted ranks in the Sea of Clouds feel it unfathomable to allow the posts to be unmanned for even a short period of time, and offers to pay trustworthy outsiders a good sum of money to go on patrol and annihilate any threats to security.	2.4	0	9538	466	0	5581915	5891108	151	1	4	0	2116	2300	87	0	2100	80014	65757	110088	56	14	20	10	34	1	11	2	6

I grow weary of the goblins' impunity in attacking our men and harboring a fugitive, so I would employ an adventurer to rid us of the beastmen entirely.

The dark tome's binding unraveled in the scuffle, and the pages flew hither and thither.

Someone must go back to the Dravanian hinterlands, gather the pages, and rid the realm of any creatures that may manifest. 	0.6	0	1358	462	0	5581915	5888235	155	1	4	0	2033	2300	87	0	2001	80014	65760	110086	58	14	20	1	34	1	8	5	6
904	Whither the Morbol Goeth	A morbol's breath is already an extremely potent agent out in the open, ergo concentrating it into a purer form would make it lethal to any living being. The initial research done by the knights' weaponry division shows that morbol breath may be able to linger in a canister devoid of air, which could be fastened to the hull of an airship and dropped on roosting dragons. The scholars of weaponry have only been able to conduct its research from considerable distances and have found the bad breath dissipates too hastily to collect samples. Thusly, they request a live morbol on which to perform more experiments. The monsters can be found aplenty in the vicinity of Sharlayan, but allow me to dispatch some valuable advice before you depart; the last adventurer we hired for the job unsuccessfully tried to bind the thing with rope and had both of his hands melted off by the putrid spray in the process.

The unbelievers grow bolder every day, flaunting the laws of the Holy See with aggressive gestures. I rarely give orders beyond the walls of Ishgard, yet they tempt me so in their profane behavior, spitting out expletives that tarnish Halone and thus beckon the rulings for heresy. I will pay good coin to the adventurer who can protect the integrity of Sharlayan by offering the goblins the chance of exile from the place.

906	Necrologos: His Treasure Forhelen (L)	A lowborn woman approached our ministry and confessed a serious crime committed by her father. Labor had taken the man on a long expedition \xe2\x80\x9cnorth of the western highlands,\xe2\x80\x9d and on the eve of his return, the woman could hear her father repeating mysterious dark words from his bedchambers. Upon inspection of his room, she was horrified to find a torn excerpt of the \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03Necrologos\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 hidden beneath his pillow. We raided his home and confronted him on his heresy, but he ingested the pages before we could seize him, claiming that he had long waited for this moment to allow the great powers of the void to overtake him and inflict hell on earth. The fool did not realize a mortal man does not transform into an unnatural being of the void through devouring its evil words, and his \xe2\x80\x9cgrand transformation\xe2\x80\x9d reduced his cursed body to ash before our eyes. As naught but a ripped excerpt did he obtain, the rest of the tome must be out yonder, and we seek an adventurer to investigate the original location of his place of \xe2\x80\x9clabor,\xe2\x80\x9d most likely in the Dravanian hinterlands, to see if the tome can be found.

907	Bareback Riding (L)	One of the more colorful Temple Knight commanders has divulged his ungranted wish to tame and ride a morbol into battle, hoping to use the forth-facing toxins to disable any Dravanian in his path. Of course, I disagreed as it would insult our trusted steeds, and showed much skepticism to being able to mount such a beast to which he merely said \xe2\x80\x9cHave men not tamed ferocious coeurls and behemoths as their war mounts?\xe2\x80\x9d I would not be truthful if I didn't say I would feel some sort of gratification to watch him brave the stench and climb the thing. Bring me pacified morbols so I may be successful in proving such folly. 	2.4	0	9926	467	0	5581915	5888236	151	1	4	0	2033	2300	87	0	2001	80014	65764	110086	58	14	20	10	34	1	23	2	6
908	Splinter in the Sewers	There has been much commotion in the church over shielding the grand spires, yet those priests see not the more pressing dangers in Ishgard's underlying veins. The planks that cover the sewers of Foundation have been gutted by falling debris, and half-wits have been seen throwing gods-know-what into one such reeking chasm. Refuse breeds rats, rats breed disease, and disease is indiscriminate in choosing its hosts, wealthy or poor. A straight plank of cedar lumber is needed to build a temporary pallet until the engineers can repair the mess.	1	95040	520	298	0	5852425	0	153	5	4	0	2300	2300	88	0	62	80014	918025	110089	50	14	0	1	9	0	18	5	6
909	So You Think You Can Lance?	Every Ishgardian is to answer the call to arms in the event of a draconian invasion, yet truth be told, we have not the manpower to hold regular training sessions for peasants. Give a lowborn a spear, and he'll protect his home for nary a bell before he falls. Teach a lowborn to spear, and a militia can be built without spending a penny of the knights' coffers on training or salary (Halone forbid). The knights have found a willing merchant to learn the thrusts and twists of the lance in one go, and he demands a suitable weapon with which to teach the others.	1	109544	572	298	0	5852425	0	151	5	4	0	2300	2300	88	0	62	80014	918026	110089	50	14	0	1	9	0	18	5	6
910	Almost as Fun as Slingshotting Birds	Although the Horde's mindless minions befoul the skies above the capital, our dragonkiller bolts must be conserved for more threatening entanglements with their wyrm cousins. As a productive way to pass the doldrums and keep the clutter out of our midst, the lord commander has decreed that every common man must learn archery to down any smaller fiends they encounter. If every man is to train in the bow, there must be a bow for every man.	1	54772	572	303	0	5852425	0	151	5	4	0	2300	2300	88	0	62	80014	918027	110089	50	14	0	1	9	0	26	5	6
911	The Lumber of Their Discontent (L)	Draconian talons scrape along the taller columns of the capital and the knights can ill afford to allow the costly resources of mortar and brick go to the defense of shanties in Foundation when the High Houses raise such a din of their own welfare. Naysayers further grumble about not enough compensation put towards grave damage to the areas around the Brume, to whom I would send sturdy stacks of cedar lumber to silence their discontent.	1	190080	2600	308	0	5852425	0	153	5	4	0	2300	2300	88	0	62	80014	918028	110089	50	14	0	10	9	0	18	2	6
912	Sticks and Stones (L)	As the bulk of the Temple Knights have been charged with protecting the High Houses and officials of the Holy See, the order has warmly welcomed the notion of a militia composed of Ishgardian civilians, which would keep watch over areas that the knights may be unable to defend in the event of an invasion. Dozens of men have already expressed their willingness to stand up against those who mock their city, and are eager to undertake simple training in how to use a lance. It takes not a weapons master to thrust a pugil stick at a Dravanian attempting to enter a home, especially if the tip is stamped in mythrite.	1	219088	2860	308	0	5852425	0	151	5	4	0	2300	2300	88	0	62	80014	918029	110089	50	14	0	10	9	0	18	2	6
913	Living Bow to Mouth (L)	While the knights have been mandated to arm the common man with tools of the archer for defense of the capital, 'twould seem the more desperate of the lowborn have taken to breaking up their cedar bows to be used as firewood to heat their homes. I care not if those ungrateful wretches shiver until their lips turn grey, for this is scarce the time for selfish actions as the dragon curs breathe upon our gates. The bows will have to be replaced, along with a decree that any who use the tools of the state for unintended purposes are to be locked in the gaol to ponder their obstruction to Halone's divine wish. 	1	54772	858	313	0	5852425	0	151	5	4	0	2300	2300	88	0	62	80014	918030	110089	50	14	0	10	9	0	26	2	6
914	Do You Even String Bow? 	What started out as a simple sponsorship for an archery competition by the Congregation has turned into a grand affair as the High Houses caught wind with their natural instincts for rivalry. The contest has been rendered exclusive only to highborn archers, and will involve all forms of moving targets and dazzling displays of accuracy on chocoback. Quite a show will be had, which means an equally suitable prize must be given to the winner. I seek none but the finest carpenters to submit a bow design of their choosing to serve as the grand prize, and the carpenter of the winning bow shall be paid handsomely for it.	1	122918	624	299	0	5852425	0	151	5	4	0	2300	2300	88	0	62	80014	918031	110089	52	14	0	1	9	0	18	5	6
915	Landing the Big One	It has been said the best deals are struck during a session of fishing, and it just so happens yours truly was invited by Baron Thieveneux of House Dzemael, a staunch and wealthy patron of the Temple Knights to partake in such a leisure. Outside of the capital? Halone forbid! No, no, I have been invited to the manor's expansive ponds, stocked with the best and built by Dzemael hands. There is much profit to be had for the coffers from a leisure such as this, so I find myself in need of a fine cedar fishing rod...though not \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03too\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 fine, mind you. I would yield the fattest carp to the master of the House of Rook as I try to catch even bigger fish. 	1	122918	624	299	0	5852425	0	153	5	4	0	2300	2300	88	0	62	80014	918032	110089	52	14	0	1	9	0	18	5	6
916	A Reward Fitting of the Faithful	Able-bodied men border heresy when they refuse to join the knights in the battle against the Horde. They could learn much from Jasper, a deaf-mute with a twisted leg who wakes before sunrise to spend the day hammering wooden planks and roofing destroyed buildings. Though born of such circumstances, he is deserving of the Temple Knights' appreciation, and a just reward to boot. A blessed cedar necklace should guide him in his prayers.	1	78624	728	304	0	5852425	0	153	5	4	0	2300	2300	88	0	62	80014	918033	110089	52	14	0	1	9	0	26	5	6
917	Win One Bow, Get Three Free (L)	'Twould seem that the winning bow-maiden of a High House-held archery contest has become enamored so with her prized holy cedar composite bow that she would like to commission you to carve three more in the same likeness. One to gift to her lord, one to present to the church as an offering to the Fury, and one to mount on her wall as decor. You have either quite the admirer or an exploitation of an inflated ego.	1	245836	3120	309	0	5852425	0	151	5	4	0	2300	2300	88	0	62	80014	918034	110089	52	14	0	10	9	0	18	2	6
918	Fishing for Profits (L)	In concurrent fishing sessions with nobles in each of the High Houses, I have been able to secure double the patronage of last quarter in addition to supplemental equipment for the volunteer militia. To commemorate the auspicious business, I would send a cedar fishing rod to each of the lords in the hopes that they will take the bait on invitations for more excursions.	1	245836	3120	309	0	5852425	0	153	5	4	0	2300	2300	88	0	62	80014	918035	110089	52	14	0	10	9	0	18	2	6
919	Just Rewards for Just Devotion (L)	After the siege on the capital, the repairing of the harrowing havens of the Brume was left to those who live there. Although their woodworking is not the quality of noble engineers, their labors towards rebuilding Ishgard have not gone unnoticed, and I would like to reward them in some way. Mayhap they may find some solace in the greater power of Halone if they were to be given cedar necklaces to use in their prayers.	1	78624	1092	314	0	5852425	0	153	5	4	0	2300	2300	88	0	62	80014	918036	110089	52	14	0	10	9	0	26	2	6
920	License to Heal	The hour is near for the final trial for the students of the scholasticate chosen to use their wisdom and healing prayer for the sake of Halone on the battlefield. The purification ritual must be conducted using a rod carved from dark chestnut, untainted by hands other than the carpenter who has crafted it.	1	157248	728	300	0	5852425	0	154	5	4	0	2300	2300	88	0	62	80014	918037	110089	54	14	0	1	9	0	18	5	6
921	The Darkest Hearth	I know of a frail old woman in a Coerthan cabin who spent her days spinning cloth for war banners, and preferred to sit windowside and watch the passersby as she worked. While the Calamity had spared her in the fortune of her remote location, it confined her to stare at the glow of the hearth instead, reminding her of the burning hellfires of that day but remains as the only place where her fingers will not become bitter and numb with the cold wind's bite. Build for her a spinning wheel made from dark chestnut, wood that will not catch fire easily should bits of kindling snap and hiss out from the hearth. 	1	184032	832	300	0	5852425	0	153	5	4	0	2300	2300	88	0	62	80014	918038	110089	54	14	0	1	9	0	18	5	6
922	Walking on Pins and Needles	The Dravanians ever harry my wagons, and I have already lost too many this moon. Metal cargo holds would surely keep against the fiends, but there are none to be had with the necessary resources relegated to greater concerns. Thus I must make do with wood. Mayhap chestnut lumber, as it forms nasty splinters when broken, I am told. If even a few dragons are forced to limp away, I will at least have that satisfaction.	1	78624	728	305	0	5852425	0	153	5	4	0	2300	2300	88	0	62	80014	918039	110089	54	14	0	1	9	0	26	5	6
923	Purified Polyrhythm (L)	While many seminarians of the Saint Endalim Scholasticate show great aptitude for defensive and restorative magicks, they must also be capable of employing the destructive kind as the situation demands. We have need of three suitable rods for the upcoming trials to join the vaunted ranks of the Temple Knights.	1	314496	3640	310	0	5852425	0	154	5	4	0	2300	2300	88	0	62	80014	918040	110089	54	14	0	10	9	0	18	2	6
924	Fruit of the Loom	The frigid temperatures of Coerthas build character and the withal to brave the elements in combat, but even beasts know to retreat to shelter when the wind becomes so cold that breath turns to icicles. A handful of infantrymen prefer to spend these volatile days keeping the company of an elderly spinster, who dedicates herself entirely to weaving the material to be raised high as our flags in battle. They ask for dark chestnut spinning wheels to assist the crone in her commendable efforts. 	1	368064	4160	310	0	5852425	0	153	5	4	0	2300	2300	88	0	62	80014	918041	110089	54	14	0	10	9	0	18	2	6
925	Like Lemon on a Lumbercut (L)	As I lamented the loss of another wagon to the Horde, a curious report came across my desk regarding the efficacy of bitterdrake as a deterrent against dragons. A splendid idea came to mind, that we might refurbish the wagons with dark chestnut wood treated with bitterdrake oil, ensuring any dragon that attacks our caravans will suffer a most unpleasant surprise. Deliver to me the finest lengths of lumber that work might begin posthaste.	1	78624	1092	315	0	5852425	0	153	5	4	0	2300	2300	88	0	62	80014	918042	110089	54	14	0	10	9	0	26	2	6
926	The Long Armillae of the Law	The master carpenter of House Dzemael has outdone himself with designs he assures me will better withstand a Dravanian assault. What mockery 'twould be if the dragons could not destroy a wooden building with their infernal breath! I grow excited at the prospect and would show my support with a gift of chestnut armillae carved with the Rook's sigil.	1	198778	936	301	0	5852425	0	153	5	4	0	2300	2300	88	0	62	80014	918043	110089	56	14	0	1	9	0	18	5	6
927	Don't Ask Wyvern	I have received unfortunate news that one of our supply vessels headed towards Falcon's Nest was assailed by a wyvern, littering broken bows and bodies upon Coerthan cliffs. The wife of a perished merchant grits her teeth for vengeance instead of compensation, and has requested a quality hallowed chestnut composite bow, the same stock lost along with her beloved. When asked why she wanted naught but this, she expressed she wanted to spend the rest of her days drifting from vessel to vessel in the skies, tracking the very wyvern that robbed her of her former life so no other will feel the pain she has endured. 	1	184032	832	301	0	5852425	0	153	5	4	0	2300	2300	88	0	62	80014	918044	110089	56	14	0	1	9	0	18	5	6
928	Aim to Please	It's simple knowledge for any greenhorn in archery to keep the arrow at the height of your eyes as you aim, but a poor lowborn bastard training for the volunteer militia let an arrow fly too close to his face and nearly took his own eye out with the feathered end! Useless, the lot of them, but it can't be helped especially if it gives the poor a reason to help the campaign. Craft him a hallowed chestnut mask of aiming so he is less like to hurt himself and more like to let arrows fly in the face of nightmares with scales and teeth.	1	92016	832	306	0	5852425	0	151	5	4	0	2300	2300	88	0	62	80014	918045	110089	56	14	0	1	9	0	26	5	6
929	Wooden Ambitions (L)	House Dzemael's master carpenter at Falcon's Nest has requested a set of chestnut armillae for every member of his guild, vital equipment for protecting the wrists of the artisans from protruding nails, splintering wood and the unexpected axe to the wrist. The craftsmanship of Dzemael goes without rival, hence I would refuse them not for what they desire if it means an even sturdier barracks.	1	397556	4680	311	0	5852425	0	153	5	4	0	2300	2300	88	0	62	80014	918046	110089	56	14	0	10	9	0	18	2	6
930	A Sky Pirate's Life for Me (L)	Following a tragic airship ambush by wyverns, a fellowship of Ishgardian merchants have decided enough is enough, and rally behind an enraged widow to form a wandering brigade of armed escorts eager to dock any ship to splatter the decks with wyvern gore. The Temple Knights welcome any man or woman that holds such hatred against the foe to take to arms of their own accord, so I would ask you make them bows with tightened strings that sing as the curs fall from the heavens.	1	368064	4160	311	0	5852425	0	153	5	4	0	2300	2300	88	0	62	80014	918047	110089	56	14	0	10	9	0	18	2	6
931	To Protect My City, I Must Wear a Mask (L)	The ranks of archers in the militia have been steadily increasing, and they demand wooden masks with which to \xe2\x80\x9cprotect their identities.\xe2\x80\x9d I suppose civilians fear such trivial things as a Dravanian outflyer remembering their faces. If they were to perform their duty properly, the last thing the enemy would behold would be the scarlet pool of its own blood.

932	Birch, Please	In the aftermath of Vishap's assault on the Steps of Faith, there has been a flurry of plans to rebuild Ishgard's defenses, one in particular calling for the construction of a new ballista watchtower. The urgency of the situation calls for vast amounts of lumber, and of a kind sturdy enough to support a two-tonze dragonkiller. Bring us as much birch as you can so construction can begin posthaste.	1	198778	936	302	0	5852425	0	153	5	4	0	2300	2300	88	0	62	80014	918049	110089	58	14	0	1	9	0	18	5	6
933	Anatomy of a Drill Bit	Ordinary arrows do little more than tickle our scaled foes, and many a foreign sellsword learns this too late, and to their sorrow. Nay, in order to do real damage, the arrowheads must be made sharp enough to shave with. To achieve the edge we seek, we're always in need of grinding wheels, and no ordinary ones at that.	1	200232	988	302	0	5852425	0	153	5	4	0	2300	2300	88	0	62	80014	918050	110089	58	14	0	1	9	0	18	5	6
934	Hold on Adamantite	The dragoons tasked with aiding House Durendaire in retaking the Stone Vigil have proposed the usage of the formation known as the Barbed Adamantoise, in which men join shields and march in unison with protruding spears to deter attack. Adamantite spears are one of the few weapons strong enough to shatter Dravanian skulls and will prove worth a trial run.	1	99389	936	307	0	5852425	0	151	5	4	0	2300	2300	88	0	62	80014	918051	110089	58	14	0	1	9	0	26	5	6
935	Built This City on Blocks and Soul (L)	The Temple Knights are more concerned with security and stability and would settle for a complete lack of decor, even if 'twere an utter eyesore. Yet the Holy See views the world in a completely different shade, and the new ballista watchtower to be built in the capital has fallen under the eye of the theocracy, which requests for adjustments to the building plans\xe2\x94\x80more dignified, more majestic, more sacred. An expansion of the tower means an extensive amount of wood to build it, to which I would request your carpentry skills.

936	Pulling Them to the Grind (L)	The Skysteel Manufactory has made vast improvements to our arrowheads, marrying traditional archery with machinistry, and the lord commander has ordered production to increase threefold. More sharpened arrowheads means a new line of dragonscale grinding wheels with which to whet them, and a cofferful to whoever can deliver them the swiftest.	1	400464	4940	312	0	5852425	0	153	5	4	0	2300	2300	88	0	62	80014	918053	110089	58	14	0	10	9	0	18	2	6
937	Spears for Stone Vigilantes (L)	House Durendaire has had much success in recent days in spilling the brains of mewling Dravanians across the chambers of the Stone Vigil with its shield-to-spear Barbed Adamantoise posture, and seeks to increase the squadrons of knights tenfold using the tactic. The Horde has amassed more followers to challenge the knights in the Vigil's courtyard for what could intensify into an all-out bloodbath.

938	Pummeling Abroad	House Fortemps, in its queer taste for the exotic, has initiated a bizarre exchange which allows for one outsider\xe2\x94\x80a pugilist from Ul'dah\xe2\x94\x80to come to teach the men his art while one of our machinists travels abroad. The student has been here nary a fortnight and makes high-handed demands for his lesson, in this case, a belt that can properly take a kick in the gut.

939	From Mud to Mourning	Bards regale audiences with the tales of victories, failures are carried by whispers and mourning, yet none recall what happens on the field in the immediate aftermath of a battle. Out of sight, out of mind, as one would say, but when the chirurgeons have done all in their power, a special mortuary team arrives\xe2\x94\x80primarily lowborn and devoid of talents in combat\xe2\x94\x80to salvage ammunition and decide proper treatment for the war dead, and they have much need for attire that can endure the roughness of the terrain.

941	Below Tradition's Belt (L)	Pugilism has piqued the curiosity of some of the knights, and through the coffer provisions list, I have seen an unusual increase in orders inked for belts abetting the art. However, the leatherworkers of Ishgard have tossed the list with scorn, barely holding their tongues of condemning the knights to using outside influences.

While the fiend was vanquished, the carnage was such that the deceased cannot be returned to the capital, and we have no choice but to bury them in the field. Other armies may leave their dead to rot as they press on, but Halonic law states that all knights are to be prepared for their ascension to Her halls, and thus I have asked for a handful of priests to join the mortuary contingent, who must needs replace their thin slippers with something more formidable for the journey.	1	245836	3120	408	0	5852425	0	153	9	4	0	2300	2300	92	0	62	80014	918059	110089	50	14	0	10	13	0	18	2	6

'Twould be unthinkable to allow the commoners of Foundation to keep space on the roofs of the manors with their unkempt miens, so the maidservants have volunteered to learn archery\xe2\x94\x80on the condition that they wear soft gloves, as their hands must be kept soft and free of dirt for accommodating their lords and ladies.	1	47520	780	413	0	5852425	0	151	9	4	0	2300	2300	92	0	62	80014	918060	110089	50	14	0	10	13	0	26	2	6
944	You Could Say It's a Moving Target	Swift and cunning bastards wyverns are\xe2\x94\x80as if the rats of the sky can read our minds. When one veers left, our archers let fly on the right. It stops its wings and drops towards earth when it hears the ballista's twang, only to pick up again after the bolt is set on its path. A seasoned knight can adapt to these maneuvers, but should a greenhorn make a misperception, it could mean death for an entire squadron. Wyvernskin is what I need, stretched across a frame and tied to a bateleur's neck for target practice.	1	122918	624	399	0	5852425	0	151	9	4	0	2300	2300	92	0	62	80014	918061	110089	52	14	0	1	13	0	18	5	6
945	Maybe He's a Lion	A Convictor by the name of Lioneleaux has gained some fame among his kind for felling a much-feared wyvern captain that left only men's heads to fall from the clouds. His accomplishment is to be praised, for the death of the guts-griping monstrosity has opened supply routes once closed off due to the threat. To honor such a momentous victory, I would have a \xe2\x80\x9clion\xe2\x80\x9d mane of wyvernskin fashioned for him in his family's name.	1	140746	676	399	0	5852425	0	151	9	4	0	2300	2300	92	0	62	80014	918062	110089	52	14	0	1	13	0	18	5	6
946	(Don't) Love the Skin You're In	There are some who swear that the skin of a dragon will writhe ever so slightly around your arms when its brethren are near, for the flesh yet yearns to join the roaring song though the spirit may be in the hells. Whether there is truth to this or not, it serves to keep soldiers ever alert to the dread tightening of their dragon hide tunics.	1	61459	624	404	0	5852425	0	151	9	4	0	2300	2300	92	0	62	80014	918063	110089	52	14	0	1	13	0	26	5	6
947	They Call It Bloody Mary (L)	The knights train their archers using an enormous mannequin in the form of a Dravanian subordinate, hung from a chain and filled with Dzemael tomatoes in the heart, head and abdomen\xe2\x94\x80should an arrow hit its mark, one would know straight away with the resulting spray of juices. Unfortunately, too many good shots over time also make for a mushy mess pouring out of the punctures, attracting flies and stray animals. The old skins on the mannequin must needs be replaced with fresh ones, to which I would entrust you the task.	1	245836	3120	409	0	5852425	0	151	9	4	0	2300	2300	92	0	62	80014	918064	110089	52	14	0	10	13	0	18	2	6
948	The Wyvern of It (L)	A lone Convictor knight has succeeded in slaying a deadly wyvern, and I would bestow upon him a reward befitting his accomplishment. The helm will mark him for a hero among his brothers and sisters, and it is my hope that they, too, will be inspired to great feats in the name of the Holy See.	1	281492	3380	409	0	5852425	0	151	9	4	0	2300	2300	92	0	62	80014	918065	110089	52	14	0	10	13	0	18	2	6
949	Belting Out the Low Notes (L)	This volunteer militia about which the Holy See has been so enlivened is starting to look no more than a regular mercenary unit, and their demands are becoming such. I've warned about giving the commoners equal armor as the men who train as deathbringers, but it seems to fall upon deaf ears so long as it fulfills the word of Halone as every Ishgardian as warrior. I have no choice but to serve up wyvernskin belts on a silver platter, but I would complain not if you chose to withhold quality.	1	61459	936	414	0	5852425	0	151	9	4	0	2300	2300	92	0	62	80014	918066	110089	52	14	0	10	13	0	26	2	6
950	Overall, We Blend In	The village of Hemlock in the western highlands of Coerthas was thought to be abandoned, but rumors have surfaced that men are attempting to reclaim the ruins for sinister purposes. The inquisition would like to send one of their own to investigate, disguised as a farmhand returning home. She must needs look convincing, and thus requires suitable garb.	1	184032	832	400	0	5852425	0	153	9	4	0	2300	2300	92	0	62	80014	918067	110089	54	14	0	1	13	0	18	5	6
951	Tally Ho, Chocobo	I know of a hunter in Tailfeather who has perfected his posture on loosing arrows from chocoback with such deadly accuracy that he could be confused for a right cavalier...if it were not for the dismal lack of barding on his chocobo. 'Tis a pity for both, as the bird would be more like to cooperate if it were not kicked and scraped on the sides by shoes made of hard tack leather. Deliver me a pair of soft dhalmelskin boots so the poor thing will have some sort of protection.	1	171864	780	400	0	5852425	0	153	9	4	0	2300	2300	92	0	62	80014	918068	110089	54	14	0	1	13	0	18	5	6
952	Dragoon Drop Rate	When we make our rounds to the Congregation's training facilities to choose hopefuls for the Knights Dragoon, I have noticed the uptick in lowborn numbers among the new recruits. While it is good to give them the benefit of the doubt as their desperate situation allows them to take more risks than their highborn counterparts, sense it does not make to give candidates quality armor from the start\xe2\x94\x80they have a nasty habit of dropping. 	1	85932	780	405	0	5852425	0	156	9	4	0	2300	2300	92	0	62	80014	918069	110089	54	14	0	1	13	0	26	5	6
953	Eviction Notice (L)	To prevent the ruins of Hemlock from turning into a nest of Dravanian harriers, the Holy See has ordered refugees currently residing in Foundation to return to the western highlands and restore their village to pre-Calamity form. Sew up sets of Hamlet's traditional garb to be sent to the refugees' places of residence in Ishgard as a message marking the end of their stay. 	1	368064	4160	410	0	5852425	0	153	9	4	0	2300	2300	92	0	62	80014	918070	110089	54	14	0	10	13	0	18	2	6
954	Hunting Heretics (L)	A small cadre of hunters in the Chocobo Forest had caught an unbeliever with knife in hand ready to slit the throats of the hatchlings being groomed for divine service. When she fled through the trees, they gave chase and kept her deposed until the knights arrived to serve the Fury\xe2\x94\x80by hanging the witch from the bough of a caelumtree. The hunters are looking hungrily for a reward, to which I would commission you thus for boots a might nicer than the pieces of fetid old leather hanging from their ankles.	1	343728	3900	410	0	5852425	0	153	9	4	0	2300	2300	92	0	62	80014	918071	110089	54	14	0	10	13	0	18	2	6
955	Exploiting the Adroit (L)	Children who lose their fathers to the jagged maws of Dravanians make fine candidates for the ranks of the dragoons, for theirs is a special contempt which cannot be found in the hearts of ordinary men. The commanders can oft tell who they are, and thus seek to nurture that hatred through painful sessions which force them to relive their nightmares. The ranks will be thinned out sure enough, hence we must make use of breeches tough enough to withstand the grazing of sharp teeth, but expendable enough for those who crack from the pressure.	1	85932	1170	415	0	5852425	0	156	9	4	0	2300	2300	92	0	62	80014	918072	110089	54	14	0	10	13	0	26	2	6
956	Don't Sweat the Small Fry	One of the spryer recruits for the Knights Dragoon has bested a lesser drake that wandered into field training, and his comrades have mockingly titled him \xe2\x80\x9cwyrmslayer\xe2\x80\x9d ever since. Feh. How generous naivety is that they would sooner piss themselves upon encountering a formidable wyrm of Nidhogg's choosing. Nevertheless, the lad does deserve some recognition for his feat. Present me with a pair of dragonskin wristbands to commemorate his small victory.	1	198778	936	401	0	5852425	0	156	9	4	0	2300	2300	92	0	62	80014	918073	110089	56	14	0	1	13	0	18	5	6
957	I Need Your Glove Tonight	A knight who sustained dire injuries when he fell from a cliff would have perished had it not been for a passing Halonic priest, who offered a most unusual \xe2\x80\x9cprayer.\xe2\x80\x9d If I did not know better, I would say he has a true healing gift\xe2\x94\x80one that is often reserved for chaplains. I would much like to express our gratitude for the knight's rescue with a pair of dragonskin gloves to aid him in his future endeavors.	1	184032	832	401	0	5852425	0	154	9	4	0	2300	2300	92	0	62	80014	918074	110089	56	14	0	1	13	0	18	5	6
958	Trainin' the Neck	I'm sure you've seen what a herculean task it is to slay a dragon mightier than the ones that mindlessly roam the land. Though its magnitude allows for expectation on its movements, a draconian of that size has power to shock a soldier still. With the help of the Skysteel Manufactory, we have been undertaking the creation of a full-sized model in the likeness of a large Dravanian, complete with wooden joints that move as a dragon would, a torch pipe to breathe fire as a dragon would, and now, it must needs be armored as a dragon would. Bring us enough circles of dragon leather to form the neck.	1	92016	832	406	0	5852425	0	151	9	4	0	2300	2300	92	0	62	80014	918075	110089	56	14	0	1	13	0	26	5	6
959	It's All in the Wrists (L)	Oh, how I do enjoy putting fresh-faced dragoon hopefuls in their place\xe2\x94\x80especially those prized peacocks who strut about and boast of the unnecessarily ornate helms that their noble fathers had bestowed upon them. So foolish are they to forget it is the wrists at which a Dravanian snaps, for manipulating the slicing of the lance. After all, what good is a head without wrists to command? The gudgeons will learn soon enough as their training proceeds, so I would commission you for sets of dragonskin bands to prepare them for their rude awakening.	1	397556	4680	411	0	5852425	0	156	9	4	0	2300	2300	92	0	62	80014	918076	110089	56	14	0	10	13	0	18	2	6
960	Halonic Drake Handlers (L)	It would seem the priests of the Holy See have taken to more desperate measures since fewer Ishgardians have been seen worshipping in the church, and have taken to the streets to torture a dragon-like scalekin in chains wearing naught but their acolyte robes, showing if one believes in the superior powers of Halone, they will come to no harm in their massacre of the dragons. As a hospitalier, I cannot condone these actions, but there are none to object to the will of the Holy See and its ministries. I suppose I will need extra sets of gloves on hand to address the emergency surgeries that will follow.	1	368064	4160	411	0	5852425	0	154	9	4	0	2300	2300	92	0	62	80014	918077	110089	56	14	0	10	13	0	18	2	6
961	Training Is Only Skin-tight (L)	We have commissioned the Skysteel Manufactory to build a life-sized model dragon for use in drills. Alas, while the machine functions as it should, its appearance leaves a little something to be desired. In order to enhance our knights' training experience, we require a goodly supply of dragonskin to drape over the body.	1	92016	1248	416	0	5852425	0	151	9	4	0	2300	2300	92	0	62	80014	918078	110089	56	14	0	10	13	0	26	2	6
962	Starting Off on the Wrong Foot	Through the fire and flames of their rigorous training, even those candidates of the Knights Dragoon who show much promise are ill-prepared for the final test. It is not a matter of skill but awkward gait, as they are unaccustomed to the burden of the traditional plate bestowed upon them. Before bearing the lance, the candidates must know the weight of serpentskin armguards pressed against their muscles, thus quality work is required.	1	200232	988	402	0	5852425	0	156	9	4	0	2300	2300	92	0	62	80014	918079	110089	58	14	0	1	13	0	18	5	6
963	Bar of the Bannermen	A greenhorn bowman tied a folded Ishgardian battle standard to one of his long arrows, and loosed it from atop a knoll nearby so that it stuck in one of the wooden frames and unraveled in its beautiful blue beauty. He meant it to serve as a warning to the Horde skulking the corridors that House Durendaire would have its retribution without question. The knights were motivated so by his boldness that they commenced another offensive soon after, taking back two of the strongholds. Such respect for the power of morale is deserving of reward, and I would pay you to fashion a belt of serpentskin for the lad.	1	198778	936	402	0	5852425	0	151	9	4	0	2300	2300	92	0	62	80014	918080	110089	58	14	0	1	13	0	18	5	6
964	It Will Knock Your Socks Off	One of the esteemed chosen custodians of the arcane barrier of Saint Daniffen's Collar has completed his initial assessment of the damage, but not without a minor setback. It would seem in his boiling frustration at the few barriers left intact, he kicked one of the remaining active wards, delivering a shock to his system that knocked him straight into the air. Luckily, he was able to recover with Halone's good graces, but his boots had absorbed the impact from the barrier and were promptly torn to shreds. He sheepishly asks they be replaced.	1	100116	988	407	0	5852425	0	153	9	4	0	2300	2300	92	0	62	80014	918081	110089	58	14	0	1	13	0	26	5	6
965	Raising the Dragoons (L)	At last, the final trials for the Knights Dragoon are upon us, and this year's candidates have proven to be the most propitious in quite a long time\xe2\x94\x80all from fine bloodlines, all burning with acrimony towards their scaly adversaries. They call the trial a \xe2\x80\x9cmock battle,\xe2\x80\x9d yet the only thing mocking about it is that their adversary is not a full-grown wyrm. They will have full reign to demonstrate their skills, thus the birth of a dragoon merits celebratory armor for use in the test.	1	400464	4940	412	0	5852425	0	156	9	4	0	2300	2300	92	0	62	80014	918082	110089	58	14	0	10	13	0	18	2	6
966	Do My Little Turn on the Stonewalk (L)	As House Durendaire claws back into the Stone Vigil inch by inch, they have been successful in securing one of the wide stone awnings within the keep, and archers of reputable skill are being summoned to prevent the dragons from regaining territory. Such a task calls for armor fit to keep the bowmen's backs straight for bells at a time. If you can bring me belts by twilight, I shall pay you double\xe2\x94\x80slow shipments should stand not in the way of Durendaire bowmen launching arrows into the throats of our enemies on the eve of a prosperous advance.	1	397556	4680	412	0	5852425	0	151	9	4	0	2300	2300	92	0	62	80014	918083	110089	58	14	0	10	13	0	18	2	6
967	On My Own Two Feet (L)	The acolytes of the scholasticate left with the daunting task of repairing the broken wards of Saint Daniffen's Collar have seen their numbers depleted due to a recent hushed purge of heretics among their ranks, those whispered to have given secrets of how to release the wards. It is most unfortunate that the remaining faithful find themselves collapsing with aether's toll on their systems in lieu of the absent members. I pray you, sew me pairs of boots imbued with supplemental properties to allow them to stand their ground, and stand it tall. 	1	100116	1482	417	0	5852425	0	153	9	4	0	2300	2300	92	0	62	80014	918084	110089	58	14	0	10	13	0	26	2	6
968	Barring the Gates to Foundation	The knights in recent weeks have been dedicating more consideration for unspeakable events such as a full invasion of Ishgard, what it would entail, and what would result. For instance, in such a place as Foundation, one can imagine the chaos that would ensue should smaller wyverns land and chase women and children into the narrow alleyways, ripping them limb from limb. Spears and arrows would be no match for such a gruesome scenario, but a katzbalger in hand could be quite useful in dispatching these foes.	1	109544	572	318	0	5852425	0	151	6	4	0	2300	2300	89	0	62	80014	918085	110089	50	14	0	1	10	0	18	5	6
969	Punching Your Way to Success	As part of a military arts exchange facilitated by House Fortemps, a pugilist from Ul'dah requests a set of arms to demonstrate the...primitive power of his discipline. I've not ventured to Ul'dah in many years, and as you are well aware, we have not the conception of such ungraceful weapons. I suppose you are the only one whom I could task with creating a pair of patas that bear resemblance to that of which he speaks.	1	109544	572	318	0	5852425	0	151	6	4	0	2300	2300	89	0	62	80014	918086	110089	50	14	0	1	10	0	18	5	6
970	With Bearings Straight	The outer shells of the ballistas are sure as steel, but just as men without armor, the inner workings of the dragonkillers are delicate and fickle. A dragonkiller that cannot spin and shoot as swift as the Dravanian soars could mean the deaths of hundreds of men. We must find a worthy blacksmith for hammering out mythrite bearings\xe2\x94\x80bring me smooth samples and I will see to it you are well paid.	1	47520	520	323	0	5852425	0	153	6	4	0	2300	2300	89	0	62	80014	918087	110089	50	14	0	1	10	0	26	5	6
971	Starting Young (L)	The communities of Foundation have been granted permission by the Holy See to conduct defensive training for children too old for wet nurses yet too young to join the knights' ranks. I have not the slightest idea who will be teaching these children to properly use weapons, but the Holy See has spoken, and we are in need of sets of katzbalgers with short reach and small grip\xe2\x94\x80simple enough weapons for the little ones.	1	219088	2860	328	0	5852425	0	151	6	4	0	2300	2300	89	0	62	80014	918088	110089	50	14	0	10	10	0	18	2	6
972	Foreign Exchange (L)	An Ul'dahn pugilist under sponsorship of Fortemps seeks to teach the knights what use hands can be in the case their weapon is disarmed. I scoff at the notion of pummeling a dragon at close range like some angry yeti, however it would seem the men are enjoying the lesson, much to my chagrin. They have started asking for ridiculous claws made of mythrite, to which I'll task you to create for the sake of the lesson. But Halone help me should this thirst for foreign weaponry go too far, as I will have no qualms about putting an end to it entirely.	1	219088	2860	328	0	5852425	0	151	6	4	0	2300	2300	89	0	62	80014	918089	110089	50	14	0	10	10	0	18	2	6
973	Bearing the Brunt	Very clever the Dravanians were in their most recent invasion, for they took special care to disable the dragonkillers first, knowing the ballistas could turn the tides rapidly. While many of our beloved contraptions of death have survived the brunt of the flames and crushing weight, the more sensitive internal gears have been ravaged beyond repair\xe2\x94\x80bearings that allow the contraptions to pivot on command must needs be replaced.	1	47520	780	333	0	5852425	0	153	6	4	0	2300	2300	89	0	62	80014	918090	110089	50	14	0	10	10	0	26	2	6
974	It's All about Execution	I am in need of a tool of execution for a heretic found to be in perjury after dragon spawn was found in her cellar. An axe, you say? Perish the thought! None of the forsaken should be afforded the luxury of a quick clean death for offending the Fury. A longsword wrapped in barbed twine makes for so much the better, as the barbs interfere with the blade, unraveling and entangling with muscle, allowing for three whacks. That should give the convicted enough time to contemplate their birth, adolescence, and death before reaching the gates of the first hell. Mayhap you disagree with my methods?

975	Freight and Barrel	Rumors have surfaced of heretics using the knights' supply caravans as a way to quickly move from operation to operation, traveling in barrels and crates in the hull. The Holy See has granted permission of ordinary supply crewmen to arm themselves with a weapon that does not encumber their regular chores, provided any heretic discovered is to be put to death. A pair of stilettos should serve the purpose quite well, as knives can be used for rigging, rope-cutting, and gutting any heretics found belowdecks at a moment's notice. 	1	140746	676	319	0	5852425	0	153	6	4	0	2300	2300	89	0	62	80014	918092	110089	52	14	0	1	10	0	18	5	6
976	Cautionary Cutlery	No matter how enticing a plump dragon's flesh may seem to a unit of starving knights, one must never consume its flesh for it amounts to both treason and madness with both a just cause for beheading. Knights stationed in places of the far corners of the map find good meats hard to come by, surrounded by creatures of tough hides and lean composition. A utensil made from mythrite may allow for easy cuts to be carved out and boiled into a stew, and I would have you design a possible prototype to be added to the mess kits.	1	70373	676	324	0	5852425	0	153	6	4	0	2300	2300	89	0	62	80014	918093	110089	52	14	0	1	10	0	26	5	6
977	Too Big to Miss (L)	These are dark times that enshroud Ishgard, when heretics arise from their feathered beds to stir the hearts of the purest, causing the Pillars to clamor that the sinful tongues of the unfaithful must be held accountable. In the name of those vulnerable, we Holy Inquisitors have appealed to the Holy See to grant us powers of an even swifter trial. As they have answered our wish, we require longswords to carry on our persons at all times for particularly sudden sentences. Should you craft us these weapons of justice, I would ensure you are paid very well for your services.	1	281492	3380	329	0	5852425	0	155	6	4	0	2300	2300	89	0	62	80014	918094	110089	52	14	0	10	10	0	18	2	6
978	Stepping on My Heart with Stilettos (L)	A group of questionable gentlemen seem to have boarded a personal air vessel of mine in the Sea of Clouds and asked to be armed with three pairs of stilettos in order to leave the ship and its very supple and desirable passenger unharmed for more interesting work in killing our foes as per Halone's divine command. I would ask you most graciously to provide them to me so they can get to work immediately. Blackmail? No, no. I've just not the time to deal with such trifling matters with the intensity of focus on the war effort!	1	281492	3380	329	0	5852425	0	153	6	4	0	2300	2300	89	0	62	80014	918095	110089	52	14	0	10	10	0	18	2	6
979	Saw, Shank, and Redemption (L)	The Temple Knives, culinarians sent to serve men in the field, have reported that their blades are dull, their ranks fewer, and the snapping drakes near their campfires are increasing in number. The Knives would much prefer to be supplied with cooking utensils that are forged from the same materials as the weapons wielded by their comrades, as they are wont to gut Dravanians as any other Ishgardian. Provide me with a set of mythrite knives suitable for cutting up dhalmel shanks and dragons alike.	1	70373	1014	334	0	5852425	0	153	6	4	0	2300	2300	89	0	62	80014	918096	110089	52	14	0	10	10	0	26	2	6
980	I Could Feel That from Here	One can find many uses for skins stripped from the bones of our enemies\xe2\x94\x80armor, decoys, wiping at the latrine. While one can use their imagination in desecrating the flesh of a dragon, there are not many knives as capable of cutting through such tough material as titanium. A knife smithed with a titanium edge so sharp that the dragon will still scream from hell as it feels its flesh get sliced into pieces.	1	171864	780	320	0	5852425	0	153	6	4	0	2300	2300	89	0	62	80014	918097	110089	54	14	0	1	10	0	18	5	6
981	I Saw the Pine	I heard the carpenters of House Dzemael decided to have a competition on one of their days of rest to see who could cut through a bough of birch the fastest using naught but a rusty amateur's saw\xe2\x94\x80the winner's branch was finally lopped off at the four-bell mark! While it was all in good fun, I do think he should be rewarded with a cleaner cut since the blisters on his hands will not heal any time soon\xe2\x94\x80a saw of hardsilver should do most nicely. 	1	171864	780	320	0	5852425	0	153	6	4	0	2300	2300	89	0	62	80014	918098	110089	54	14	0	1	10	0	18	5	6
982	Keep Up with the Mechanics	The Skysteel Manufactory requests a smith worthy of creating some sort of flintlock that will accommodate their machinists' newfangled art. Such weaponry is a mockery of the gifts of war that Halone has bestowed upon us, and thus the blacksmith guild that serves the Temple Knights has declined to take up the offer to forge the strange contraption. I suppose an outsider like you would probably fare better at granting the manufactory's request. I'll even pay you coin for it so they will stop whining in mine ear.	1	78624	728	325	0	5852425	0	151	6	4	0	2300	2300	89	0	62	80014	918099	110089	54	14	0	1	10	0	26	5	6
983	Tensions in Creasing (L)	Halone's fortune favors the brave, and the slaying of a great draconian foe has given us the bounty of bone and scales! But we must make haste to peel the hides off before the bateleurs eat their fill\xe2\x94\x80such valuable material must not go to waste when it can be cut and sewn into garments that look upon the Dravanians with scorn as we storm them in combat. We need creasing knives forged from titanium, on the double!	1	343728	3900	330	0	5852425	0	153	6	4	0	2300	2300	89	0	62	80014	918100	110089	54	14	0	10	10	0	18	2	6
984	I Came, I Sawed, I Conquered (L)	Through our failures do we persevere, and retribution has always been Ishgard's greatest weapon. As piles of shattered dragonkillers lay at our feet, the See's craftsmen are sworn to utmost secrecy as they toil from dawn to dusk working out the skeleton of a new design that will stand the stress tests of both fire and claw. As scrolls of each new prototype fill the planning room, the models dull the teeth of the carpenters' handsaws, thus replacements are in order for them to continue their sessions.	1	343728	3900	330	0	5852425	0	153	6	4	0	2300	2300	89	0	62	80014	918101	110089	54	14	0	10	10	0	18	2	6
985	Unconventional Weaponry (L)	Machinists. Bah. While we've no qualms about introducing advancements from the Skysteel Manufactory to our arsenal, any knight worth his salt knows the weapons ordained by the Fury Herself\xe2\x94\x80the bow, the sword, and the lance\xe2\x94\x80are the ones most like to please the goddess in rendering a more painful and excruciating death. Alas, I have an accord with the manufactory on technology, yet they wish to display the pomp and pistols of their machinists in battle. I'll humor them this once, but I'll not have our blacksmiths distracted from their crafts of traditional weaponry. Thus I would rely on you to provide them with whatever armaments they desire.	1	78624	1092	335	0	5852425	0	151	6	4	0	2300	2300	89	0	62	80014	918102	110089	54	14	0	10	10	0	26	2	6
986	Unbreaker	Only a handful of dragonkillers have special chain pikes and are structured in such a way that keeps them mobile, yet ably bolted to the ground at a moment's notice. Both the pike and the locks must be made of titanium, for if the dragon is too strong, the ballista will be lifted into the air; if the chains are too weak, they shall break and set the monster free\xe2\x94\x80as was the case when the dread Vishap broke through his fetters. Bring me ingots of titanium with which to craft the pieces.	1	184032	832	321	0	5852425	0	153	6	4	0	2300	2300	89	0	62	80014	918103	110089	56	14	0	1	10	0	18	5	6
987	Diamond Sawdust	The restoration of the capital would proceed a great deal quicker if only the handsaws would cooperate. You would think the See's slack-salaried blacksmiths would be able to create aught to accommodate the climate turning wood into ice, but innovation has never been their strong suit, and what good is a handsaw if the teeth are worn down to the nub before a single run through the grain? Forge me a sturdier tool, I will be sure to make it worth your while. 	1	193190	884	321	0	5852425	0	153	6	4	0	2300	2300	89	0	62	80014	918104	110089	56	14	0	1	10	0	18	5	6
988	Spirituality Inspector	The Temple Knight blacksmiths may be mere craftsmen, yet their work does not escape the strict oversight accorded by the Holy See. One priest has been a thorn in my side, miserable of his duty and worries more of dirtying his silk robes than unceasing production of equipment. Disgusted by the ash and soot of one of the shops, he declared the smithing tools to be \xe2\x80\x9ctainted,\xe2\x80\x9d which could merit an inquisitor visit. Luckily, the artisans were merely punished with one-hundred recitations of a famous passage from the \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03Enchiridion\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 and the tools discarded. Somehow, I feel giddy at the prospect of their new tools being replaced by an outsider's hand.	1	96595	884	326	0	5852425	0	153	6	4	0	2300	2300	89	0	62	80014	918105	110089	56	14	0	1	10	0	26	5	6
989	Attack on Titanium (L)	The order has come down from on high for a drastic change in the arsenals of the dragonkillers. Every pike made of wood and iron is to be replaced with those made entirely of titanium. As if such resources are abundant enough to grow on trees! I have the difficult choice of having less bolts than before or swallowing my pride and rounding up more blacksmiths from outside of Ishgard's gates to complete the entire order. Pray do not disappoint me.	1	368064	4160	331	0	5852425	0	153	6	4	0	2300	2300	89	0	62	80014	918106	110089	56	14	0	10	10	0	18	2	6
990	I'm a Lumberjack and I'm Okay (L)	The terrain has become enshrouded in more peril since the Dravanians' emboldened assailed upon Ishgard. While the foe is more like to ignore those but Temple Knights, it would seem that they have developed quite the taste for unarmed purveyors of botany, and their bodies ravaged with fang and scorch marks alike tell the tale. 'Twould seem men of any Discipline of the Land cannot survive without a much heavier arsenal, thus I desire a blacksmith who can use their talent to create axes which might be used to fell both trees and dragon alike.	1	386380	4420	331	0	5852425	0	153	6	4	0	2300	2300	89	0	62	80014	918107	110089	56	14	0	10	10	0	18	2	6
991	The Clamor for Hammers (L)	Ever since the catastrophic events which emboldened our Dravanian adversaries, the smithing guilds have been working their hammer arms to the bone and the hammers themselves to the nub in answering the clamor for better weapons. While struggling to fill the never-ending orders of the Temple Knights, they barely have enough time to repair their own tools before the next arsenal is sent out. There is much coin to be had for a freelancer who can forge them durable hammers\xe2\x94\x80titanium may last longer than others.	1	96595	1326	336	0	5852425	0	153	6	4	0	2300	2300	89	0	62	80014	918108	110089	56	14	0	10	10	0	26	2	6
992	Through Thick and Thin	Under normal circumstances, one would laugh at the notion of a bowman or maiden standing their ground against a towering champion of the Horde, yet that would be underestimating the arsenal at the Temple Knights' disposal. Our arrows are made not from wood, but materials harder than diamonds\xe2\x94\x80a well-placed pierce through a dragon's throat could just as easily incapacitate the foe as one of the dragonkillers! Such shafts, however, are saved only for the most elite marksmen and women, as such, they pay handsomely for adamantite with which to outfit their arrows.	1	198778	936	322	0	5852425	0	153	6	4	0	2300	2300	89	0	62	80014	918109	110089	58	14	0	1	10	0	18	5	6
993	Winter Weather Conditions	The ballistas are much fretted about with care, yet the most vital work comes at dawn when the contraptions are coated in a thick sheet of ice, sealing the gears and immobilizing the pivot chambers. The faster an engineer can pick off the large chunks, the faster the dragonkillers can feed metal into the bare chests of sin. For that, the sharpest dolabras are desired.	1	200232	1040	322	0	5852425	0	153	6	4	0	2300	2300	89	0	62	80014	918110	110089	58	14	0	1	10	0	18	5	6
994	Swords for Plowshares	Following a failed attack by the Horde, a wounded dragon flew as far as the central highlands before falling to earth in a narrow mountain pass, blocking the road. One of our knights, properly equipped, should be capable of hacking the frozen carcass to pieces and reopening the pass to trade.	1	99389	936	327	0	5852425	0	151	6	4	0	2300	2300	89	0	62	80014	918111	110089	58	14	0	1	10	0	26	5	6
995	Piercing Eyes Deserve Piercing Shafts (L)	When an archer releases an arrow, it must be done with some certainty it will hit its mark as the stock is limited. The elites must be even truer to hitting their marks with arsenal of such rare commodity that even time is lost with one release of the string, for it takes days to create a single arrow of adamantite that pierces even the strongest dragonscale. As a result of the Horde's invasion, my need of adamantite nuggets is acute for those elite bowmen stationed along Ishgard's walls.	1	397556	4680	332	0	5852425	0	153	6	4	0	2300	2300	89	0	62	80014	918112	110089	58	14	0	10	10	0	18	2	6
996	The Nightsoil Is Dark and Full of Terrors (L)	Mayhap more darker purpose than prank, someone has poured buckets of sewer water onto rows upon rows of dragonkillers, knowing full well that by morning they would become encased in thick filmy sheets of ice and piss. 'Twould seem punishment for one engineer to break all of the weapons from their statues of scum, therefore sets of dolabras are needed for an entire team to pick out the ballistas.	1	400464	5200	332	0	5852425	0	153	6	4	0	2300	2300	89	0	62	80014	918113	110089	58	14	0	10	10	0	18	2	6
997	Negative, They Are Meat Popsicles (L)	Oft mistaken for hills or debris left by the Calamity, frozen corpses of the Horde are blights on the land and bitter reminders to the knights who lost brothers and sisters in battle.

998	Your Tasset's Hanging Out	I have always said one cannot trust the baseborn too heavily with the divine task of Halone, for their upbringing in such squalor claims their own welfare before even the Fury. We caught one such man last week, in the midst of him selling his provisioned tassets to settle the debt of his induction into the ranks. He has since been beheaded, so I would ask you to craft another set of tassets to replace the stock lost.	1	95040	520	338	0	5852425	0	153	7	4	0	2300	2300	90	0	62	80014	918115	110089	50	14	0	1	11	0	18	5	6
999	Rivets Run Through It	The grand gates to the city must be able to open and shut at a moment's notice, barring any monstrosities from barreling at the city proper. In light of the devastating consequences that could occur from a Dravanian invasion, the engineers under the auspices of the Temple Knights have commenced replacing the bolts and rivets that hold the vital physical barriers together, and coin will be had for the armorer who can produce mythrite rivets to deny the Horde entry to our sacred city.	1	109544	572	338	0	5852425	0	153	7	4	0	2300	2300	90	0	62	80014	918116	110089	50	14	0	1	11	0	18	5	6
1000	Don't Scuttle with Scutums	No sooner than the dragon takes the air into its lungs that knights must raise their shields to protect them from the following conflagration. Alas, in the unfortunate event that Ishgard is once again under siege by the Horde, every alleyway is the front line, and ill-trained men are more like to burn in their homes than face the fiends head-on. I seek to restore confidence in the volunteer militia by providing them with scutums resistant to the flames, in hopes that when the time comes, they'll have enough wits to use them.	1	54772	572	343	0	5852425	0	151	7	4	0	2300	2300	90	0	62	80014	918117	110089	50	14	0	1	11	0	26	5	6
1001	Tassets Approval (L)	Within the span of one moon, three men of dubious class have reported their mythrite tassets missing, stolen, or beyond repair, and I somehow sense foul play at hand. Swindlers must be punished in giving away the property granted to them to fulfill the Fury's divine wish, and I will have not the knights' armor used for wicked purpose. If it's tassets they want, then you shall craft them for me for good coin. But this time, I will mark them thus and see if they end up in the dark corners of the Crozier, and the culprit shall answer with their hands.	1	190080	2600	348	0	5852425	0	153	7	4	0	2300	2300	90	0	62	80014	918118	110089	50	14	0	10	11	0	18	2	6
1002	A Riveting Revival (L)	While dragons are wont to attack with fire, fang, and claw, the more brazen of the beasts use their bodies as battering rams. In this way have too many of our watchtowers been reduced to splinters. The new towers we are building must be stronger than the old, and to this end we need stronger rivets, among a host of other materials.	1	219088	2860	348	0	5852425	0	153	7	4	0	2300	2300	90	0	62	80014	918119	110089	50	14	0	10	11	0	18	2	6
1003	Shielded by Bureaucracy (L)	Shields, they insisted. For what reason would the merchants and labormen of the Brume require that which even a fledgling knight would struggle to put to use? I oft wonder what will become of this voluntary militia the Holy See has whipped up into a froth\xe2\x94\x80while the extra security is appreciated, the first shields out the guild should be given to those who have dedicated their souls to combat. Alas, the commoners have appealed through the Holy See, knowing well we cannot refute the law of the land. As our official armorers are already over-taxed with orders for more \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03imminent\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 combat, I would commission you to craft shields you feel the commoners deserve.	1	54772	858	353	0	5852425	0	151	7	4	0	2300	2300	90	0	62	80014	918120	110089	50	14	0	10	11	0	26	2	6
1004	Let Faith Light the Way	Treks into the Sea of Clouds are long and arduous, and the less that our men need carry the better. Hence, the order seeks to commission an armorer who can forge a shield for battle that might also serve as a source of light after dark.

1005	The Cut Alembical Cord	As a student of medicine, I tended to scoff at practitioners of alchemy. It was not a forbidden art in my youth, yet it seemed no more than mere biast oil extraction when compared to those righteous trades condoned by the church. Then the capital's doors closed and I soon realized how the same utensils of alchemy were used in the experimentation of new remedies, now exotic commodities in Ishgard's isolation.

1006	Pan That Laid the Golden Egg	After several flagons of ale, a House Dzemael blacksmith made a wager with two Temple Knives that he could forge liquid gold in their pans as one would cook an omelette. 'Twas trickery, however\xe2\x94\x80no sooner did our men agree that the blacksmith pulled out a wedge of cheese and popotoes.

1007	Fifty Shields of Blades (L)	War games that pit neophytes against one another are essential to the training, but it should not cost the Holy See more than what they're worth. Youthful vigor is all well and good, but dented bucklers pile up like plywood, and the recruits respect not the weapons nor the time and coin it takes to forge them. Serrated blades along the edges of a shield should turn horseplay into hard discipline for fear of a nasty slicing.	1	281492	3380	349	0	5852425	0	151	7	4	0	2300	2300	90	0	62	80014	918124	110089	52	14	0	10	11	0	18	2	6
1008	Sheer Distill Power (L)	The constant flow of ailing men and women from battlefields and manors alike provide a catalyst for greater resourcefulness in the practice of medicine. I oft wonder if there are paths to be forged along the lines of alchemy, of plant and animal biles that could be put to widespread use in rarer illness. Mayhap an outsider such as yourself could present me with some prototypes that could separate the extract of plants to allow for a wider berth of medicinal discovery.	1	245836	3120	349	0	5852425	0	154	7	4	0	2300	2300	90	0	62	80014	918125	110089	52	14	0	10	11	0	18	2	6
1009	Skillet With Fire (L)	Field culinarians, or the \xe2\x80\x9cTemple Knives\xe2\x80\x9d are a curious breed, gruff in spirit and able to prepare a feast with minimal ingredients and tools. They are also prone to violent action should anyone intrude upon the sanctity of their kitchen. Their frypans caliente make fearsome weapons, for I have heard tales of bandits who dared to steal foodstuffs fleeing in terror, clutching their charred faces. One such incident has prompted a request for new pans, as the residue stuck to the bottoms of their current ones is interfering with their cooking.	1	61459	936	354	0	5852425	0	153	7	4	0	2300	2300	90	0	62	80014	918126	110089	52	14	0	10	11	0	26	2	6
1010	As the Bolt Flies	As dragons fly, the heights will provide them with protection so long as our dragonkillers cannot reach them. How far a bolt flies is entirely dependent on the strength of the cog-gear that holds the tension and propels it into the dragon's soft underbelly upon release\xe2\x94\x80the more tension it can hold, the more like it can destroy a dragon's perception of \xe2\x80\x9cflying to safety.\xe2\x80\x9d The methods of creating the cog-gears is a matter of secrecy, yet the coffer of the manufactory would swing wide to an armorer who could bring them titanium nuggets of worthy quality with which to research how much tension it could hold.	1	157248	728	340	0	5852425	0	153	7	4	0	2300	2300	90	0	62	80014	918127	110089	54	14	0	1	11	0	18	5	6
1011	Someone Put Dung in My Helmet	The candidates for the Knights Dragoon are always under intense pressure that leaves both their heads and faith pounding by the end of a training session, to which some forget even the most common of sense. One of the youngbloods was daft enough to place his sallet next to a roped and very well-fed chocobo during his training respite. Needless to say, no amount of water or prayer is going to get the unholy smell of droppings and shame scraped out of the metal. He will need a replacement helmet posthaste.	1	157248	728	340	0	5852425	0	156	7	4	0	2300	2300	90	0	62	80014	918128	110089	54	14	0	1	11	0	18	5	6
1012	Sometimes the South Wins	In memoriam of our knights' heroic foray in the Autumn War against the Ala Mhigans, the Holy See is sponsoring the annual reenactment with knights solely from the four High Houses, two houses on each side. The recreation of the historic battle is in name alone, as the knights never cast off their reputations and the victorious side appears to change every year. Roughhousing is expected and thus quality armor is needed so that the knights may save their intended armor for our Dravanian foes.	1	85932	780	345	0	5852425	0	151	7	4	0	2300	2300	90	0	62	80014	918129	110089	54	14	0	1	11	0	26	5	6
1013	Heavy Metal Banned (L)	The wyverns mock Ishgard, sailing their wings with pride as the wind carries them hundreds of malms into the air out of reach of the precious dragonkillers. The manufactory has completed experiments with lighter metals with great success, and so the order has been carried out for all of the ballistas in the capital to be replaced with cog-gears birthed from titanium, strong enough to launch a bolt a hundred malms high without stripping wood from windlass. Let the Dravanians smirk no longer, and let the skies forecast downpours of blood from on high.	1	314496	3640	350	0	5852425	0	153	7	4	0	2300	2300	90	0	62	80014	918130	110089	54	14	0	10	11	0	18	2	6
1014	Rage against the Scream (L)	As their training forces the Knights Dragoon to respond violently to the screams of dragons, the candidates to join the ranks prefer to use sallets of titanium. Rumor has it that not only is the headpiece as light as a feather, but as the wind blows through the crevices, it mimics such a wail and allows the wearer's hatred to course through their veins tenfold at the mere sound.	1	314496	3640	350	0	5852425	0	156	7	4	0	2300	2300	90	0	62	80014	918131	110089	54	14	0	10	11	0	18	2	6
1015	The Thriller of Autumn (L)	The annual reenactment of a famous Ishgardian victory against the barbarians in the Autumn War is nigh, and the knights of the noble houses have begun their training exercises for period-accurate field warfare. The strategy used in the historic battle differs somewhat from those in our holy duty, as we charged men rather than beasts. Hence the noble knights participating in the mock battle have requested armor made of titanium\xe2\x94\x80light enough to practice running laps for the charge, but still strong enough to withstand a lance thrust.	1	85932	1170	355	0	5852425	0	151	7	4	0	2300	2300	90	0	62	80014	918132	110089	54	14	0	10	11	0	26	2	6
1016	A Squire to Inspire	There have been whispers in the Pillars of an assassin, some say sent from a High House, stealing away in the night to the manor of Haillenarte and trying to stab a knight clad in naught but her nightdress. The blade was diverted by the woman's squire who took the knife in the knight's stead, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cSo as long as Halone blesses your sword, your death shall be by dragon claw and not by a sullied man's hands.\xe2\x80\x9d The blasphemy-monger was swiftly dispatched and the boy treated, but so moved was I by this remark of virtue that I will pay a purseload of coin to the armorer who can craft me a set of tassets to honor the squire.	1	184032	832	341	0	5852425	0	151	7	4	0	2300	2300	90	0	62	80014	918133	110089	56	14	0	1	11	0	18	5	6
1017	A Halonic Masquerade	If you do not cut off the disease at the source, it will continue to spread and manipulate the other parts of the body. We have known for quite a while about Lady Iceheart's treacherous group of knaves, yet it would seem that one faction has splintered off into their own ideology, calling themselves \xe2\x80\x9cpeacemakers,\xe2\x80\x9d yet wearing masks to conceal their identities. The heretics love to use honeyed words to reach the ears of the optimists, so there is need to eliminate the \xe2\x80\x9cpeace\xe2\x80\x9d at any cost through their own devices. I want you to forge a proper scouting mask for me, and tell not a soul if you value your tongue.	1	184032	832	341	0	5852425	0	155	7	4	0	2300	2300	90	0	62	80014	918134	110089	56	14	0	1	11	0	18	5	6
1018	Belle of the Brawl	The knights assigned to capital patrols are oft dissatisfied with their delegation, for it does not compare to those brothers who brave the heat of dragon fire. Hence the fools are more like to vent their vexations ale-sopped, pummeling lowborn ungrateful for their service. Unfortunately, one such brawl has left a peasant less one wife after being struck in the face with a gauntlet. In customary circumstance, the knights would be pulled out into recess, yet with the threat of a Dravanian siege looming over my head, I can afford not to dismiss men of considerable skill. In lieu, I must keep them chastised and the baseborn quiet and sated with his demand\xe2\x94\x80armor fresh from the forge.	1	92016	832	346	0	5852425	0	151	7	4	0	2300	2300	90	0	62	80014	918135	110089	56	14	0	1	11	0	26	5	6
1019	All's Fair in Highborn Assassination (L)	The squire of House Haillenarte who saved his master from assassination is quite vulnerable to retaliation from whomever sent the behest. I have heard rumors of an unwritten code of the High Houses, judging that the person who protected the target of an assassination must have revenge enacted upon himself as well as the original prey, unless the hit is called off as too bothersome a task. 'Twould make sense as so frequent are the vindications that even the nobles themselves bat nary an eye. Nevertheless, the Rose has ordered an extra squadron of bodyguards to be sent to protect the boy, and they are in need of tassets with which to prevent from a gutting themselves. 	1	368064	4160	351	0	5852425	0	151	7	4	0	2300	2300	90	0	62	80014	918136	110089	56	14	0	10	11	0	18	2	6
1020	Why I Wear a Mask (L)	My comrades in justice are adept at slipping in and out of the shadows\xe2\x94\x80to catch a heretic, one must mimic their ways with a stout enough resolution to remain untainted and see to the end that the heathens fall hundreds of feet to their death. We are in need of disguises, yet I trust not in the armorers of Ishgard for this task, for there may already be an infestation among their ranks who would sooner spread the word if it meant impeding our righteous work. I entrust it to no soul but you outsider, for if the conspirators anticipate our arrival, there could be but one source.	1	368064	4160	351	0	5852425	0	155	7	4	0	2300	2300	90	0	62	80014	918137	110089	56	14	0	10	11	0	18	2	6
1021	Shouldering the Shut-ins (L)	The ranks of the volunteer militia grow steadfast, with more peasants signing up for equipment by the bell. As knights train in order to grow into their shells, I have my doubts that naught but those who have delved in the smithing trade have enough meat on their arms to carry a bucket of water, let alone a bastard sword. I need someone who can forge something lightweight for the arms that will not hinder the militia slow as tortoises should the Dravanians storm the gates. 	1	92016	1248	356	0	5852425	0	151	7	4	0	2300	2300	90	0	62	80014	918138	110089	56	14	0	10	11	0	26	2	6
1022	Sir, Dost Thou Even Heft	One of the knights who will storm the Stone Vigil has been building muscle in a bid to make the next siege the last. While his zeal is more than welcome in the impending victory, the growth of his muscles has split the mail links in the seat of his trousers and thus he has need of an armorer able to fit his girth into a new set of adamantite chain hose before the next operation commences.	1	200232	988	342	0	5852425	0	151	7	4	0	2300	2300	90	0	62	80014	918139	110089	58	14	0	1	11	0	18	5	6
1023	Look Before You Leap	Among the aspiring Knights Dragoon are a talented few who practice jumping attacks in equipment crafted from adamantite, the weight of which will help them to crush a dragon's skull as an eggshell. Alas, one such youth misstepped during his training and landed among the crags, breaking both his legs and armor in the impact. Though his injuries will heal, he requires a new pair of leg guards, and I would entrust none other but a skilled craftsman with the task.	1	200232	1040	342	0	5852425	0	156	7	4	0	2300	2300	90	0	62	80014	918140	110089	58	14	0	1	11	0	18	5	6
1024	The Mast Chance	Some may grouse that their children will have grown before the \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03Protector\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 once again claims the skies as her own. I pay them no heed, for the more time spent, the more like the ship will be unassailable. A handful of rivets is requested to anchor the mast to the baseboards, but take care to craft them from materials which will stand to wear.	1	99389	936	347	0	5852425	0	153	7	4	0	2300	2300	90	0	62	80014	918141	110089	58	14	0	1	11	0	26	5	6
1025	Men in Adamantite (L)	The forces of House Durendaire are the cornerstone of our efforts at the Stone Vigil. To help them continue their fight against our sworn enemy, the Holy See would dispatch a shipment of supplies. Among various other materiels, it is understood that they have great need for stout leg guards suitable for heavy infantry.	1	400464	4940	352	0	5852425	0	151	7	4	0	2300	2300	90	0	62	80014	918142	110089	58	14	0	10	11	0	18	2	6
1026	Patience, Young Grasshopper (L)	The hopefuls of the Knights Dragoon are near the end of their training drills and have grown overconfident with their newfound power in the dragoon jump. A handful boast themselves invincible, and that they are more than ready to practice the jump in heavy adamantite armor, just as those veterans among the ranks. I have warned them that none but a true master of the art would be able to perform the jump with precision in such heavy armor, yet they heed me not. Very well then, the fools will know their folly once removed from the lists due to shattered ankles.	1	400464	5200	352	0	5852425	0	156	7	4	0	2300	2300	90	0	62	80014	918143	110089	58	14	0	10	11	0	18	2	6
1027	The Rose and the Riveter (L)	In the art of airship building, even the most miniscule details must not be overlooked. For all of the \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03Protector\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03's grandeur, 'twould be all for naught should the hull give out in mid-flight whence the air thins, a common fatal mistake caused by cracks between loose bolts.

1028	Little Orphan Candy	A knight patrolling the Brume was approached by a lowborn girl who exclaimed that her parents had given her a beautiful present for her nameday. Although she had been told to keep it a secret, in her excitement she revealed that it was a draconian rosary. Needless to say, the girl's parents will not be returning by supper. I would send her some sweets as thanks for her service to the Holy See.	1	109544	572	438	0	5852425	0	151	12	4	0	2300	2300	95	0	62	80014	918145	110089	50	14	0	1	16	0	18	5	6
1029	The Next to Last Supper	Upon returning to Ishgard from a Dravanian campaign, a knight learned that his young wife had been killed during the wyvern attack and buried in his absence. His sister seeks a culinarian who can recreate the dish his wife often used to cook for him\xe2\x94\x80a warm plate of rolled cabbage, so that he may mourn her in his own way before returning to the fray.	1	122918	624	438	0	5852425	0	153	12	4	0	2300	2300	95	0	62	80014	918146	110089	50	14	0	1	16	0	18	5	6
1030	The Aroma of Faith	I care not for men who cannot pull themselves out of their own misfortune, but sometimes the best way to a man's obedience to the war effort is through his taste, and the baseborn find much to hunger for these days. The Holy See is hoping that the knights might be able to entice some of the poorer to the ranks, so I am searching for a dish sample that would whet the appetite enough to consider taking up the sword, but not aught so rich to get them addicted to the life they cannot have. As a master chef, you would know better than I. 	1	61459	624	443	0	5852425	0	153	12	4	0	2300	2300	95	0	62	80014	918147	110089	50	14	0	1	16	0	26	5	6
1031	Confections of Confession (L)	A group of street urchins did not go unnoticed as they watched me give a fig barvarois to a child as a reward for pointing out blatant heresy within the walls of Ishgard. I told them there would be plenty of the sweets for any who could point the finger to more heretics so that they could be punished. With gratitude to the little ones, the knights have rounded up seven accused since the last bell, including one amongst themselves! Bake me their due sweets, and the inquisitors will be happy, the children will be happy, and for the moment, all will be safe in Ishgard.	1	219088	2860	448	0	5852425	0	151	12	4	0	2300	2300	95	0	62	80014	918148	110089	50	14	0	10	16	0	18	2	6
1032	Nostalgia through the Stomach (L)	Knights who do not fear death are the most like to be returned the Fury's embrace rather than their families. Although their brothers and sisters may have risen honorably to walk in Halone's halls, those who survive will allow for more dragons to fall at their hands and will return to the capital for a reprieve until they are dispatched once more to the campaign. Returning knights should be given a homecoming that will make them feel more at home with their loved ones, including dishes they have not supped upon in some time.	1	245836	3120	448	0	5852425	0	153	12	4	0	2300	2300	95	0	62	80014	918149	110089	50	14	0	10	16	0	18	2	6
1033	Soup's On (L)	Men who have not the coin for bread to fill their empty stomachs are more inclined to fill themselves on the bread of the forbidden word\xe2\x94\x80indeed, those who fall to their knees in poverty would rather blame the church on their ill fortune rather than their failure to put their prayers to deed, and thus Halone sees them not worthy of Her mercy. Nevertheless, the knights are more inclined to see heretics as more detrimental to the war effort than the hungry, thus the lord commander has a plan to serve the needy to rekindle the faith of the people in the Fury (and possibly recruit more men on the side). I pray you find me a dish that may be worthy of the lowborn's tastes yet for wide provision among the capital.	1	61459	936	453	0	5852425	0	153	12	4	0	2300	2300	95	0	62	80014	918150	110089	50	14	0	10	16	0	26	2	6
1034	Such a Butter Face	Culinarians may see fermented butter as no more than an ingredient for a variety of dishes. Yet knights in backwater locales often use it to shave with knives\xe2\x94\x80an alternative to the expensive creams of the capital. Fermented butter has a rich scent and salve-like texture, making it ideal for this purpose. A shipment has been requested by our forces stationed in the Dravanian forelands, to which I would consult your service.	1	140746	676	439	0	5852425	0	153	12	4	0	2300	2300	95	0	62	80014	918151	110089	52	14	0	1	16	0	18	5	6
1035	Loving That Muffin Top	Second Commander Handeloup has a tendency to remain shut up in his room for days on end, planning and provisioning the next supply caravans in the far reaches of Dravania. He had not requested it, but I think it wise to prepare him a snack to quell his empty stomach devoid of heaviness that would drift him into sleep's embrace. A simple leavened muffin should suffice.	1	140746	676	439	0	5852425	0	153	12	4	0	2300	2300	95	0	62	80014	918152	110089	52	14	0	1	16	0	18	5	6
1036	Persona non Gratin	I have been informed that House Haillenarte has agreed to have its contingents partake in joint training exercises with House Dzemael, and my hope is fixed that the supper that follows will allow for more amity among the two houses. Finding a dish that would dull sharp tongues has proven difficult, but I am confident dhalmel gratin would suffice, with thick consistency of the Dzemael variety and game familiar to Rose Knights.	1	78624	728	444	0	5852425	0	151	12	4	0	2300	2300	95	0	62	80014	918153	110089	52	14	0	1	16	0	26	5	6
1037	No Margarine of Error (L)	The infantrymen are accustomed to braving the elements and finding themselves yalm-deep in mud, sand, and dragon corpses. Yet you would be surprised what improved hygiene does for the morale of the troops, as even those who march to their deaths would prefer to greet Halone with their beards in some form of upkeep. Hence I ask for a large quantity of fermented butter not for culinary purpose, but for the men stationed in Cloudtop where scarce water cannot be used for a clean shave. It may not be the finest of lathers from inside the capital, but Halone has always taught us to be humble in our appearance and overindulgent in our combat.	1	281492	3380	449	0	5852425	0	153	12	4	0	2300	2300	95	0	62	80014	918154	110089	52	14	0	10	16	0	18	2	6
1038	Muffin of the Morn (L)	The night patrol of Ishgard is no easy task, as when heretics are most like to slip through the gates and cast their sinister plots upon a sleeping city is during the witching hour. Since the Calamity, the frigid temperatures at night have made the surveillance all the worse, as the patrolmen shiver in the wind as they walk through the streets. Exhaustion sets in as dawn approaches, and the men oft look forward to lamplight upon the warm, chewy muffins awaiting them. Supply me with the baked goods so they may find hard-earned rest on a full stomach.	1	281492	3380	449	0	5852425	0	153	12	4	0	2300	2300	95	0	62	80014	918155	110089	52	14	0	10	16	0	18	2	6
1039	Recipe for Disaster (L)	What were expected to be joint drills in good faith among the knights of Haillenarte and Dzemael has manifested into measuring the others' strength and speed, with more men joining in by the day. Halone forbid if the nobility put more energy into slicing up dragons than boasting who has downed more of them. I can only hope that dinner will briefly hush the incessant churl-hurling\xe2\x94\x80heaping servings of thick dhalmel gratin should keep them chewing for a while.	1	78624	1092	454	0	5852425	0	151	12	4	0	2300	2300	95	0	62	80014	918156	110089	52	14	0	10	16	0	26	2	6
1040	The Nutcracker's Sweets	While I care not for the meetings at the Congregation on matters of Ishgard's defense, I recognize the gravity of their outcomes and informing the High Houses and the church proper. Therefore, I find myself quite annoyed when one of the Vault's cardinals insists on bringing a pouch of imported Gridanian walnuts, cracking the shells open with his teeth during the deliberations. The noise is most distracting, so I would have you prepare a substitute that would make for a quieter refreshment to be placed at his seat ere he enters the room.	1	193190	884	440	0	5852425	0	151	12	4	0	2300	2300	95	0	62	80014	918157	110089	54	14	0	1	16	0	18	5	6
1041	Breakfast of Champions	The training for the volunteer militia composed of Foundation residents was meant to be brief, yet one of the more rotund merchants is already whining he cannot continue running laps around the forums without a proper meal in his stomach. Provide me with a canteen filled with emerald soup to shut him up, but pray make the broth thin\xe2\x94\x80if he can't hold it in, it'll be easier to scrub off the cobblestone than solid food.	1	184032	832	440	0	5852425	0	151	12	4	0	2300	2300	95	0	62	80014	918158	110089	54	14	0	1	16	0	18	5	6
1042	Old Victories, New Tastes	The Holy See, tiring of the same old culinary fare, is requesting outside assistance in coming up with new tastes for a banquet on the eve of the anniversary festivities of the Autumn War.

1043	Time for a Midnight Snack (L)	I am a man of action, and much prefer directing the excitement with the contingents on the battlefield to the mundane strategy meetings in the capital. Listening to the houses droll on from their gilded cages of things nary a relation to the war front cannot compare to stomping Dravanian entrails with your boots with blood splashed across your face. What's worse, the meetings run well into the night and there is no time to break for supper. As I am in charge of preparing the next exchange, I seek a culinarian who will provide me with a meal that is easy to nibble on without making too much noise\xe2\x94\x80the nobles do hate when their prattling is interrupted.	1	386380	4420	450	0	5852425	0	151	12	4	0	2300	2300	95	0	62	80014	918160	110089	54	14	0	10	16	0	18	2	6
1044	Emerald Soup for the Soul (L)	Blasphemy is a ragged peasant swinging a mythrite sword as a drunk with a broken bottle. Without some slight oversight from the Temple Knights, these commoners of the volunteer militia are more like to cause damage than help the effort. No, they must be introduced to more intense standard training...and with any volunteer training comes more dropouts leaving with fancy weapons. Lunch must be provided to sway them to stay, I suppose. Boil me tureens of emerald soup to keep them running.	1	368064	4160	450	0	5852425	0	151	12	4	0	2300	2300	95	0	62	80014	918161	110089	54	14	0	10	16	0	18	2	6
1045	The Eats of Authenticity (L)	While battles that spill the blood of dragons are the most highly regarded, any Ishgardian victory is worthy of Halone's pride. The anniversary of our venture into the Autumn War is nigh, and knights from all noble houses will participate in the annual memoriam reenactment of the great battles against the Ala Mhigan barbarians. Some of the most holy in the church are expected to observe from canopied pavilions, and it seems they look forward to supping on cuisine reminiscent of the season in which the battle was won. As I recall, you are a fine cook of dhalmel fricassee, which would suit the occasion quite nicely.	1	96595	1326	455	0	5852425	0	152	12	4	0	2300	2300	95	0	62	80014	918162	110089	54	14	0	10	16	0	26	2	6
1046	Saucy for a Suitor	I ask this favor not in my capacity of Temple Knight commander, but in confidence as a personal matter. My daughter pursues a suitor who mentioned once in passing that he is quite fond of fish dishes. Naturally, she wanted to create for him the finest dish he had ever tasted, but used grass carp in her main course, a fish so bitter it would cause one's face to pucker up as soon as tasted. A father should only get involved if it were a matter of threat, yet I feel adding a few drops of hollandaise sauce to the dish might be able to mask its putrid flavor. 	1	171864	780	441	0	5852425	0	151	12	4	0	2300	2300	95	0	62	80014	918163	110089	56	14	0	1	16	0	18	5	6
1047	It Goes Down Smoothly	A commander on the battlefield was caught in a crossfire by a ball of fire that burned a hole in his neck. The wound has since closed up, but while he is on the mend, there is much he cannot consume without his throat burning and gurgling up foul humours. I request a serving of frozen spirits, concocted with fresh fruit so the frigid beverage will numb his throat while assuring the proper intake of nutrients.	1	198778	936	441	0	5852425	0	154	12	4	0	2300	2300	95	0	62	80014	918164	110089	56	14	0	1	16	0	18	5	6
1048	Persuasion of a Higher Power	A priest has arranged for an audience with the lord commander regarding an urgent matter. 'Twould seem the church is looking to enact self-flagellation as part of the training exercise of every knight in the order. While I am all for religious devotion, I can see the lord commander grimacing at the thought of adding it to the already intense drills. I implore you to conjure up seafood delicacies of such fine taste that the priest's opinion might be swayed during the exchange.	1	99389	936	446	0	5852425	0	153	12	4	0	2300	2300	95	0	62	80014	918165	110089	56	14	0	1	16	0	26	5	6
1049	Saved by the Sauce (L)	In a particularly brutal scuffle with heretics inside the capital's walls, a knight came out victorious and his comrades wanted to cook a banquet to celebrate his name. It is mere bells before the food is to be served to friends and family, and I was invited for a sample taste, to which I regret. The taste was so unholy that with one bite of the gratin, I swear my tongue burned like hellfire. I ask for a culinarian with a skilled hand to mask the horrid taste and save the banquet in the one way I know how\xe2\x94\x80drown everything in hollandaise sauce.	1	343728	3900	451	0	5852425	0	151	12	4	0	2300	2300	95	0	62	80014	918166	110089	56	14	0	10	16	0	18	2	6
1050	Quenching the Flame (L)	Those hapless enough to breathe in dragon fire are left with seared throats and are unable to consume ordinary food for moons. In order to provide them with sustenance while easing their hurts, we typically prescribe a mixture of frozen mashed fruits, glasses of which we require posthaste.	1	397556	4680	451	0	5852425	0	154	12	4	0	2300	2300	95	0	62	80014	918167	110089	56	14	0	10	16	0	18	2	6
1051	Loaves and Fishes	The strategy meetings between the Holy See and the Temple Knights make for quite an awkward exchange, and the gap of perception is even wider come supper. The high cardinals always insist on naught but the finest gourmet dishes served on silver platters with La Noscean wines drunk from bejeweled goblets while we knights have been disciplined to live on stale bread and our own determination. Mayhap you can whip up a course to bridge the two.	1	99389	1404	456	0	5852425	0	153	12	4	0	2300	2300	95	0	62	80014	918168	110089	56	14	0	10	16	0	26	2	6
1052	Let's Not Get Sappy	The lord commander is a remarkably modest man, and shirks all splendor of the fine cuisines of the capital, instead choosing to break the same bread as any common soldier. Yet I know the one pleasure to which he indulges himself\xe2\x94\x80I have seen him put a dash of rich birch syrup in his morning tea, ever so subtly. He may complain if he were to know of my intention, but as there are few delights he can have in the immense burden he carries, I would have none other than the most exquisite drops for his lordship.	1	200232	988	442	0	5852425	0	157	12	4	0	2300	2300	95	0	62	80014	918169	110089	58	14	0	1	16	0	18	5	6
1053	Soup That Eats Like a Knight	I'm sure you have been here long enough to know what makes a good meal, one that warms to the bone and puts a fire in the belly. Emerald soup, you say? Feh, drink down that thin broth and you'll be pissing green in nary a bell's toll. Clam chowder with a thick slab of stone-hard bread, now that's a stout soup for a warrior. Ah, now that I linger on it, my stomach has started yearning for it as the night grows colder. Bring me a hot bowl of the stuff and I'll give you a handful of coin for convenience.	1	200232	1040	442	0	5852425	0	151	12	4	0	2300	2300	95	0	62	80014	918170	110089	58	14	0	1	16	0	18	5	6
1054	Don't Let It Fall Apart	A fountain of stamina is an understatement of what is required when repairing and replacing the components of the ballistas\xe2\x94\x80testing the tension, checking the chains and hammering down the base means long periods of standing or crouching under the giant contraptions. Although one can see the sweat on their brow, their obsession with the machinery and its inner workings offers them nary a moment's rest. Some would even prefer to continue to work while they eat, thus I would like to deliver them liver-cheese sandwiches that can be devoured with one hand while the wrench turns in the other.	1	100116	988	447	0	5852425	0	153	12	4	0	2300	2300	95	0	62	80014	918171	110089	58	14	0	1	16	0	26	5	6
1055	Lap of Luxury (L)	The lord commander is fond of adding a few drops of birch syrup to his morning tea, so I had imported a small potent bottle of fine vintage for his enjoyment. Alas, in receiving dire news of another assault of Svara towards our barracks I spread the map across mine table, knocking the bottle on the floor. Only after the matter had been taken care of had I noticed the dogs lapped up the lord commander's sole luxury. I aim to correct mistakes no matter how trivial, so I would ask you to procure three bottles of the rich stuff to ensure it does not happen again.	1	400464	4940	452	0	5852425	0	157	12	4	0	2300	2300	95	0	62	80014	918172	110089	58	14	0	10	16	0	18	2	6
1056	Like Ma Used to Make (L)	At last, the newest round of inductees for the Knights Dragoon have completed the final trial and a send-off banquet is to be held in their honor. While the finest chefs in Ishgard are busily preparing the main entrees for the feast, there are not enough hands in the kitchen to cook up the appetizers. I would employ your talents to come up with a hearty dish that reminds the dragoons of home whence they may not return to in a long while, if at all.	1	400464	5200	452	0	5852425	0	151	12	4	0	2300	2300	95	0	62	80014	918173	110089	58	14	0	10	16	0	18	2	6
1057	Better Come Back with a Sandwich (L)	The ballistas on the Steps of Faith require more repairs than originally anticipated and the Skysteel Manufactory has sent a number of machinists for the task. After many bells of cranking, ratcheting, and oiling, I am certain a hearty meal would give them heart and much-needed relief besides.	1	100116	1482	457	0	5852425	0	153	12	4	0	2300	2300	95	0	62	80014	918174	110089	58	14	0	10	16	0	26	2	6
1058	The Mustache Suits Him	Notices have been posted hither and thither for a wanted heretic hiding among the baseborn; yet it seems there are those who would still protect such a sacrilegious traitor. Upon passing by some of the posters, I notice many scratched up, torn. There are even those who have been defiled with coarse graffiti about the priests and their poor mothers. If the flea-bitten mutts intend to mock me, then I shall have need of mythrite ink, whose properties allow it to project beyond lesser inks which have been applied over it.	1	95040	520	418	0	5852425	0	153	11	4	0	2300	2300	94	0	62	80014	918175	110089	50	14	0	1	15	0	18	5	6
1059	Summoning for Dummies	I oft considered the entities summoned from grimoires as innately heretical, as it was mostly those who wished to unravel Halone's will who used them in their minatory schemes. Yet in recent years, I have seen many who use the power of the tomes while invoking Halone's will, and I start to wonder whether the arcanic spirits themselves are not vile of mind so long as they can quicken the death of the unbelievers\xe2\x94\x80fight fire with fire if you will. Procure me one of these summoning grimoires so I may have it inspected by the scholasticate.	1	95040	520	418	0	5852425	0	153	11	4	0	2300	2300	94	0	62	80014	918176	110089	50	14	0	1	15	0	18	5	6
1060	Forged from the Void	Despite its rather unpleasant origins, void glue is an essential tool for the forging of weapons, including the signature polearms wielded by the Knights Dragoon. As the forges of Ishgard have been burning day and night, they oft run out of the stuff and have taken on extra hands willing to produce the valuable adhesive.	1	54772	572	423	0	5852425	0	153	11	4	0	2300	2300	94	0	62	80014	918177	110089	50	14	0	1	15	0	26	5	6
1061	Forgery of Convenience (L)	Not only do I have my hands full handling the bureaucratic entanglements under emergency, but now I hear tell of a string of clever forgeries of said edicts making their way around the supply lists, with some of our best weapons going Halone knows where. 'Twould seem the culprits are connected somehow to the blasted notion to arm the baseborn with more than they deserve. The guesswork will have to be done by my assistants\xe2\x94\x80I have not the time to worry about weapons that could so easily be identified and apprehended. However, I have great incentive to replace all of the official fountains with mythrite ink, not so easily acquired thus less like to be forged.	1	190080	2600	428	0	5852425	0	153	11	4	0	2300	2300	94	0	62	80014	918178	110089	50	14	0	10	15	0	18	2	6
1062	Summoning the Courage to Be Different (L)	While Ishgard's scholars are quite adept at manifesting Halone's blessings from their ancient grimoires, summoning an entity from a tome is something that had fallen entirely outside the realm of permissible magicks, as heretics oft use them in their occultist plots. However, with more liberal interpretations for the sake of our advancements in the war, the scholasticate under the auspices of the Holy See has been granted special permission to experiment so as long as they are wrapped in the skin of a fallen dragon to remain faithful to the teachings of the \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03Enchiridion\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03.

1063	Dodging the Draft (L)	I recall the first drastic change of clime, when the High Houses had trouble with renovating their manors to adapt to the new normal. The wooden planks of the residences were originally held together with nails, but the pieces soon shattered in the coldest of nights. Since then void glue has served much better, yet requires a fresh coating every few years to ensure our lovely lords and ladies don't see their own breath in their beds. The manor of House Fortemps is next on the list for a renovation.	1	54772	858	433	0	5852425	0	153	11	4	0	2300	2300	94	0	62	80014	918180	110089	50	14	0	10	15	0	26	2	6
1064	Can't Sleep, Inquisitors Will Eat Me	A man accused of lying with a dragon has lingered in the confessional for nearly four days. My thought is if such claims are true, his spirit should burn so brightly with the dragons' lust that he would require no sleep for days, a common symptom\xe2\x94\x80or so scripture states. He remains lively still in his deprivation, occasionally pounding the door and screaming out his innocence. I tire of his claims in the face of the hard evidence, hence I beseech you to produce for me a grimoire with a high level of aetherial conductivity to lull him to sleep.

1065	Steeling the Knife, Steeling the Mind	The chirurgeons of the battlefield are equipped with the best tools Ishgard can provide, but these instruments can only be used a certain number of times before they become prone to contamination. The specialists who forge their medical utensils oft imbue them with magical properties that keep the chirurgeons' minds sharp and focused on the task of healing the wounded, and they request bottles of dissolvent of weak quality for the replenishing of supplies.	1	157248	728	419	0	5852425	0	153	11	4	0	2300	2300	94	0	62	80014	918182	110089	52	14	0	1	15	0	18	5	6

1067	Allow No Fallacies (L)	With the good graces of the Temple Knights, an entire den of snakes has been discovered through an intricate ring of finger-pointing, leading to the arrest of an entire lesser house under the provisions of guilt by association. However, there are simply too many family members to question at once to enable a \xe2\x80\x9cspeedy trial.\xe2\x80\x9d Thus we harbingers of justice request grimoires of potent writing, made from dragonskin in accordance with Halonic law, but that also store up an incredible pool of aetheric energy for every lie the heretics spew forth. 	1	245836	3120	429	0	5852425	0	155	11	4	0	2300	2300	94	0	62	80014	918184	110089	52	14	0	10	15	0	18	2	6
1068	Surgical Substitution	The chirurgeons in the theater of the forelands are always overburdened with treatments due to the proximity of the Dravanians and their rage at the incursion of territory. Until the supplies are able to reach the knights' stronghold, they have not the time for fresh surgical tools and request three bottles of the weakest mind dissolvent in substitute so the surgeries will have at least some form of sanitary protection.	1	314496	3640	429	0	5852425	0	153	11	4	0	2300	2300	94	0	62	80014	918185	110089	52	14	0	10	15	0	18	2	6
1069	Curbing the Contagion (L)	A bevy of women and children burst into the church in hysterics, having been showered by the blood of a dragon felled by a ballista strike. Wailing that the dragon's essence may have been absorbed into their skin and turned them against the Fury, they have been bowing unceasingly in prayer for nearly a bell now. As a member of the clergy, I could not possibly forsake them in their time of need\xe2\x94\x80and when they are so willing to pay the proper fee for a cleansing ritual.

1070	Adhesive of Antipathy	Oh, if 'twere true to say that an airborne dragon who has taken an arrow to the wing will never fly again. Alas, if the beast is not annihilated posthaste, it will crawl as a serpent to lie low for days until the membranes heal themselves anew. A damnable trait in warfare, but a blessing in disguise for craftsmen, for glue made from dragon wings still slowly mends itself well after the fiend expires\xe2\x94\x80bonding easily and reforming over time.

1071	Tomes Roam on the Range	It is of paramount importance that we protect our people from corruptive foreign influences and indulgences.

As interpreters of the \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03Enchiridion\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03's word, they are permitted to request these tomes from other lands.

1072	Warding Off Temptation	The cardinals' bed chamber doors are inscribed with an intricate series of wards to protect them while they sleep from heretic throat-slittings, and the Holy See is known to pay large quantities of coin to keep these wards properly maintained. After hearing some rather salacious gossip regarding a cardinal locked out of his bedchambers (and a young lady locked within), the arcane \xe2\x80\x9clocksmith\xe2\x80\x9d has beseeched me for a bottle of hardsilver ink, the aetherial conductivity of which quickens the pace of enchanting and disenchanting the wards. 	1	78624	728	425	0	5852425	0	153	11	4	0	2300	2300	94	0	62	80014	918189	110089	54	14	0	1	15	0	26	5	6
1073	It's Gonna Grow Back (L)	While the chain pikes of the dragonkillers can pinprick and barb into spine, there is naught to say some form of bonding glue cannot be applied to the tip to deny a dragon the opportunity to rip out the stick with its teeth. Mayhap it be a matter of irony that wing glue procured from dead Dravanians would be most like to bring about their downfall?

1074	Field Trip to the Unknown (L)	A group from the scholasticate have announced their intention for a field excursion to search for ruins in the remote areas of the Sea of Clouds. One can only imagine the ravage that could be done to the pages of our ancient books plucked from the comfort of their dry, preserved shelves to be taken on such a journey. 'Twould cost more coin to repair the damage to our holy library than to just set them loose with a set of tomes referencing the same scripture.

1075	The Garden of Arcane Delights (L)	Time is of the essence when it comes to repairing the arcane barriers of Saint Daniffen's Collar, and the founts of mythrite ink the scholars use have already run dry in the first round of spells. Hardsilver is thought to attract aether quicker than others, needed to meticulously bind the wards using the ancient incantations of the \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03Enchiridion\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 murmured by the scholasticate custodians.

1076	Cleansing the Wicked Humours	As if it were not luck enough to be caught unawares, an aevis ravaged a knight's side and breathed its dark magicks into the wound. The unfortunate soul was retrieved from Falcon's Nest by his brothers and brought back to the infirmary, yet his mouth has started foaming and the wound at his side has turned purple, bubbling and festering from the dragon's bewitching. Though I have not seen it myself, some say the guttering of the aevis will drown out Halone's voice of reason, commanding his mind to murder. Unless someone can produce a bottle of hallowed water with which to purify his wound, we will have no choice but to have his head removed before it succumbs to the aevis's whispers entirely. 	1	184032	832	421	0	5852425	0	154	11	4	0	2300	2300	94	0	62	80014	918193	110089	56	14	0	1	15	0	18	5	6
1077	Volunteering with Staff	My brother in the clergy has shown an innate talent that allows for him to wield a simple stick and, by the grace of the Fury, cure those who complain of headaches. I ask you to provide him with a grander-looking staff imbued with hallowed water so that he may visit the infirmaries of the city-state, granting the sick succor and ensuring the wretched souls that Halone has not abandoned them in their time of need...so as long as they are obedient to the scripture, of course.	1	184032	832	421	0	5852425	0	152	11	4	0	2300	2300	94	0	62	80014	918194	110089	56	14	0	1	15	0	18	5	6
1078	Rolling on Initiative	The unique climes found in the Sea of Clouds can either remind us of the heavens or cause us to question why Halone challenges our sight with impenetrable mists.

1079	Washing Away the Sins (L)	Hallowed water is verily the stuff of miracles, imbued as it is with Halone's grace. As a hospitalier, I have seen with mine own eyes proof of its potency to heal. I therefore take great pains to keep enough in stock for cleaning the gravest wounds of my patients. Some recover splendidly.

1080	Scripture Is the Best Medicine (L)	There are priests by occupation and there are those who are chosen\xe2\x94\x80to whom Halone has given the gift to provide succor to the sick and blessings to the frail. Alas, we live not in a time of wanton charity, and such precious talents are best employed to heal our knights in battle. Priests who have been blessed so are drafted to serve as chaplains in the field, and these chosen men and women are in need of weapons that will amplify their miraculous powers.

His shaking hands occasionally topple his inkwell, creating blotches across the pages (which I inevitably must  fill in myself to keep the record clear). Despite his flaws, I would have no other than Raitemeaux entrusted to this delicate position with decades of experience of his employ, and I would ask you to supply him with another bottle of aurum regis ink, which does not deteriorate so easily and makes the numbers in the books more or less permanent.	1	198778	936	422	0	5852425	0	153	11	4	0	2300	2300	94	0	62	80014	918199	110089	58	14	0	1	15	0	18	5	6
1083	There Was a Late Fee	The tome \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03Noble Gold\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 may seem to a layman naught but a hodgepodge of shapes and symbols, yet to those who have been properly educated, it provides a wealth of information regarding arcane barriers\xe2\x94\x80how to construct them, and how to dispel them. The scholasticate's only copy appears to be missing, and while I am sure that it was simply misplaced under a seminarian's bed or some such, it is unnerving that its gap among the others remains. I would have you provide a new copy to fill the old one's place.	1	200232	1040	422	0	5852425	0	153	11	4	0	2300	2300	94	0	62	80014	918200	110089	58	14	0	1	15	0	18	5	6
1084	The Grave of Hemlock Groves	A refugee widow from the town of Hemlock approached me when she had heard the Holy See's edict for the knights to return the villagers there in time. She was grateful for the news, but she would choose not to return due to a broken heart, for the hemlock tree which shaded her husband's grave had not only been cut down, but the tombstone had been used for a sacrificial altar and then destroyed. There is naught I can do for a blessed nameplate, but if she is more like to return should the tree be planted once more, then a potent growth formula may allow for the tallest tree in the forest. 	1	99389	936	427	0	5852425	0	153	11	4	0	2300	2300	94	0	62	80014	918201	110089	58	14	0	1	15	0	26	5	6
1085	Ink into Antiquity (L)	One thousand years of war calls for more than ten thousand pages writ of victory, with the war cry of each knight recorded and the thrashes of the Dravanians lost with their last breath. The ancient order of scribes who pen the history of Ishgard accompany the knights on the battlefield as warrior scholars, hence their journals must be able to withstand the test of time. With the rise of every new inducted scribe comes the need for ink that will tell of our never-ending cycle of both hatred and hope.	1	397556	4680	432	0	5852425	0	153	11	4	0	2300	2300	94	0	62	80014	918202	110089	58	14	0	10	15	0	18	2	6
1086	A Gate Arcane Is Dragon's Bane (L)	The Gates of Judgement stand defiant still, but not without consequence of the mind\xe2\x94\x80it is quite clear the breach has left the people of Ishgard shaken. The wards must needs be erected stronger, and there is but one tome capable of the immense power it takes to build the arcane symbols whisper by whisper, piece by piece. Although an outsider, you are one of the few alchemists I hold in esteem enough to create a copy of such a rare book. Do so, for the safety of Ishgard, and for recognition from the Fury that even unbelievers can be held with some virtue.	1	400464	5200	432	0	5852425	0	153	11	4	0	2300	2300	94	0	62	80014	918203	110089	58	14	0	10	15	0	18	2	6
1087	Dappling the Highlands (L)	On his way to the western highlands, an astrologian dismounting his chocobo had the contents of his pouch overturned, and so had spilled a bottle of growth formula onto the ground. Upon his return three days later, he noted with incredulity that a mirror apple tree several yalms high had sprouted on the path! If the story were found true, the knights could seed orchards to feed our men. But we needs make sure, bring me bottles of the stuff so we may test the soils.	1	99389	1404	437	0	5852425	0	153	11	4	0	2300	2300	94	0	62	80014	918204	110089	58	14	0	10	15	0	26	2	6
1088	Pride Up in Smoke	A Dzemael banner weaved from velveteen...what in Halone's name was that squire thinking? The Rook's reputation lies entirely on its artisans of sturdy construction and safe fortress, and the blasted fool erects a fire-prone standard near a puk den only for it to explode into flames from a single firespit for all of Eorzea to see. I'll punish the boy later, but for now, I urge you to restore Dzemael's reputation by weaving material for a new standard\xe2\x94\x80one that is not so easily consumed in flames, for your sake.	1	95040	520	378	0	5852425	0	151	10	4	0	2300	2300	93	0	62	80014	918205	110089	50	14	0	1	14	0	18	5	6
1089	Perfecting the Posture	While dragonkillers are employed to fell large Dravanians, our archers focus on piercing the throats of their smaller cousins, as wyvern spit can be just as deadly as dragon fire. To strike a moving target as thin as a neck, a bowman must focus on proper breathing, aided by the tightness of the belt around his waist. Supply me with a sash so that we may measure the area of tension for our newest recruits.	1	95040	520	378	0	5852425	0	151	10	4	0	2300	2300	93	0	62	80014	918206	110089	50	14	0	1	14	0	18	5	6
1090	Ribbon of Remembrance	In the largest infirmary of Ishgard, there is an ancient wooden statue in one of the prayer rooms in the back. It is custom for family members to tie a ribbon somewhere on the statue to aid in their prayers for their kin to become well. With a strange sickness spreading throughout the darker parts of the city the statue has been looking more like a funeral shroud as of late and the ceaseless calls for ribbons seem to be more than the weavers can handle at the moment.	1	54772	572	383	0	5852425	0	154	10	4	0	2300	2300	93	0	62	80014	918207	110089	50	14	0	1	14	0	26	5	6
1091	Desperate for Diversionaries (L)	Our standard-bearers are often seated near the point of the commander in order to give signals on the next maneuver to knights hundreds of yalms afield. However, their positioning oft make them a natural target for the Dravanians during a siege. I intend to use this for a more clever ploy\xe2\x94\x80how would the dragons react to a sea of banners scattering in every direction? 	1	190080	2600	388	0	5852425	0	151	10	4	0	2300	2300	93	0	62	80014	918208	110089	50	14	0	10	14	0	18	2	6
1092	Curb the Gnawing Feeling (L)	The archers of the volunteer militia have been pressing the knights' armory for less flammable armor, yet we have naught to spare for the commoners' pursuit of glory. Yet the Holy See backs their demands, so I would entrust the task to another for an ample amount of coin. For all of their commotion, I do hope equipping them with lavish armor will conjure some merit, for should the militia fail and Ishgard fall, they might hang themselves in their finery to spare them the pain of burning on all sides\xe2\x94\x80save the stomach.	1	190080	2600	388	0	5852425	0	151	10	4	0	2300	2300	93	0	62	80014	918209	110089	50	14	0	10	14	0	18	2	6
1093	The Road Was a Ribbon of Moonlight (L)	On the battlefield, a chirurgeon need stand apart from regular infantry, which is why we often instruct them to tie colorful ribbons to their arms. At night, however, these ribbons are difficult to see, and our men struggle to tell friend from foe. Rainbow cloth is said to shimmer in moonlight, so I seek a supply of ribbons sewn with the material.	1	54772	858	393	0	5852425	0	154	10	4	0	2300	2300	93	0	62	80014	918210	110089	50	14	0	10	14	0	26	2	6
1094	What Not to Wear	An Ul'dahn Disciple of War under the ward of House Fortemps has been strutting around Ishgard in garb so flamboyant, it would blind the holiest of men! If it weren't for the house's appeals to the Vault for other war tactics, I would have him locked up for disturbing the modesty! The least I can do is have the student wear something blessed by the priests. Then, whatever he may do, he will at least be cushioned with some form of forgiveness for flaunting himself so in the presence of Halone.	1	140746	676	379	0	5852425	0	151	10	4	0	2300	2300	93	0	62	80014	918211	110089	52	14	0	1	14	0	18	5	6
1095	Fashion Patrol	Oh, to have been around during the era that Haldrath walked this land, a time when women were pure and wore clothes devoid of flamboyancy and men were driven to prayer rather than drink. 'Tis a pity we have let ourselves succumb to overindulgence at a time obedience to Halone is needed foremost. The Temple Knights seem to reciprocate this sentiment, which is why we will have one of our own accompany knights on patrol in order to \xe2\x80\x9ccorrect\xe2\x80\x9d any who seem more enamored with themselves than devoting their all to the war effort. A notable piece of holy attire will be needed for the man on patrol\xe2\x94\x80honesty is the best policy, you see.	1	122918	624	379	0	5852425	0	155	10	4	0	2300	2300	93	0	62	80014	918212	110089	52	14	0	1	14	0	18	5	6
1096	An Account of My Apron	The chief architect of House Dzemael holds his white, frizzled head in his hands so oft these days that one would think him a phoenix in his own right. In his youth, he builds a stone bridge, and the ice of the Calamity cracks and erodes it away. In his adolescence, a village, only for the wooden creations to crackle to embers by a dragon's breath. In his last triumph, the steel walls of a city so grand that its spires near pierce the heavens, only for the Dravanians to set their beady eyes on its ruin. His crafting apron shows his age, and mayhap you can craft him one anew to lift his spirits.	1	78624	728	384	0	5852425	0	153	10	4	0	2300	2300	93	0	62	80014	918213	110089	52	14	0	1	14	0	26	5	6
1097	Appeal of Foreign Apparel (L)	With all the good intentions House Fortemps seems to bid upon, introducing exotic fighting cultures into the holy order of the knights seems all the more threatening than simply turning a blind eye to the hiring of foreign sellswords...and I am appalled that the young disciples of pugilism complain that the uniform of the knights is too cumbersome for their routines. Bah, I will have not the knights bouncing around wearing sacrilegious habiliments. I forbid it. All I can ask of you is to create garments that are somewhat tasteful that remain loyal to the faith.  	1	281492	3380	389	0	5852425	0	151	10	4	0	2300	2300	93	0	62	80014	918214	110089	52	14	0	10	14	0	18	2	6
1098	Dress Code Violation (L)	The inquisition fears that Ishgard's youths are listless, lacking in purpose, and vulnerable to the whisperings of heretics. We will work with the Temple Knights in steering the impressionable away from danger and increase our visibility along the streets of the city. To those ends, we are in need of footwear befitting an office of the Holy See\xe2\x94\x80conducive to the casting of magicks, and current with the trends of the day. Only the most skilled of artisans need apply.	1	245836	3120	389	0	5852425	0	155	10	4	0	2300	2300	93	0	62	80014	918215	110089	52	14	0	10	14	0	18	2	6
1099	Soot in My Hair and Scars on My Hands (L)	\xe2\x80\x9cSelf-preservation! Self-reliance! By our own hand!\xe2\x80\x9d Such are the war cries of the artisans of House Dzemael who showcase the greatness of Ishgard in our chosen isolation. Yet so obsessed are they with their repairs from the most recent assault that they fail to notice they are clothed in scarce more than scorched tatters. Their resolve is admirable, yet I feel they would serve our realm better should they replace those aprons so black one can scarce tell fresh grease from old ash\xe2\x94\x80mayhap asking them to bathe would be too much.	1	78624	1092	394	0	5852425	0	153	10	4	0	2300	2300	93	0	62	80014	918216	110089	52	14	0	10	14	0	26	2	6
1100	Clothing the Naked Truth	One of the scholasticate instructors took too literally the scripture which reads, \xe2\x80\x9cMan shall not indulge in excess while Her will remains undone,\xe2\x80\x9d by refusing to change his modest robes for years. While he took baths with some regularity, the moldy stench which wafted from his robes was so overpowering that he was given his own office out of consideration for his peers. By the grace of the Fury, a flamboyant gesture near a lit candle saw it turned to flame and then soot within seconds, leaving him in his altogether. I would rather him not remain so. Yet, if he is to continue his misguided practices, I would have him wear a higher quality robe than the last\xe2\x94\x80one that preferably has the power to clean itself.	1	171864	780	380	0	5852425	0	153	10	4	0	2300	2300	93	0	62	80014	918217	110089	54	14	0	1	14	0	18	5	6
1101	Storm upon Bald Mountain	The bareheaded senior engineer of the manufactory work crew is currently laboring on the backbreaking restoration of the dragonkiller ballistas. The work remains unfinished, yet the skywatchers tell of a particularly nasty snowstorm on the rise. Knowing that the work cannot cease for the sake of inclement weather, I would have you fashion him a turban to keep his head warm and as a token of my gratitude.	1	171864	780	380	0	5852425	0	153	10	4	0	2300	2300	93	0	62	80014	918218	110089	54	14	0	1	14	0	18	5	6
1102	Finger on the Pulse	Unfazed by the cold nights in the capital which can freeze water into stone and chill the bones of any who cannot afford the hearth, one of the theologians of the scholasticate has made a request for a pair of fingerless gloves weaved from ramie cloth. When I inquired as to why he would request such a thin material, he said it would allow his fingertips to gingerly touch the words of the pages of the holy book, the guidance of which would surely keep him warm. Surely you could grant the request of one so admirable in the dedication to his study of the only text worth understanding in this world.  	1	78624	728	385	0	5852425	0	154	10	4	0	2300	2300	93	0	62	80014	918219	110089	54	14	0	1	14	0	26	5	6
1103	When in Robes (L)	It seems that the capital has experienced an influx of foreign practitioners of the arcane arts...with their summoned entities in tow, the Count de Dzemael's doing, no doubt. I would not speak truth if I did not say myself and Ishgardians of common heritage are uncomfortable enough with this new trend. While the wielders assure us that they are under complete control and have naught to do with heresy, one can never be too careful, for even hounds lash out at their masters from time to time. I am sure it would set minds at ease if raiments of Ishgardian issue were distributed to such practitioners to guarantee the beasts will not run amok.	1	343728	3900	390	0	5852425	0	153	10	4	0	2300	2300	93	0	62	80014	918220	110089	54	14	0	10	14	0	18	2	6
1104	Abrupt Apprentices (L)	The engineers of the Skysteel Manufactory who bear on their shoulders the daunting task of repairing the dragonkillers before the next imminent siege have made an urgent request to the Holy See to allow for their children to forgo prayer school so that they may start learning the trade early. If there were any such time for a swift apprenticeship in cranking windlasses and holding gears, now would be such a time. The Holy See has granted them temporary leave, so I would ask you to prepare turbans fit for the work, but for smaller heads.	1	343728	3900	390	0	5852425	0	153	10	4	0	2300	2300	93	0	62	80014	918221	110089	54	14	0	10	14	0	18	2	6
1105	Chirurgeon Hand in Glove (L)	The acolytes who remain under tutelage in the scholasticate long after the mandatory elementary lessons on the sacred word can be considered the realm's foremost theological experts. Name any problem and they will quote the correct passage of the \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03Enchiridion\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 by heart to guide us on Halone's path. Yet there are some among them who hold a special skill that would have even a chirurgeon baffled. The Congregation has noticed through evoking the words of the holy scripture in their tomes, they are able to grant succor to the ailing, and have thus recruited them to the ranks. Provide me with the proper gloves for them to use in their blessings.	1	78624	1092	395	0	5852425	0	154	10	4	0	2300	2300	93	0	62	80014	918222	110089	54	14	0	10	14	0	26	2	6
1106	A Show of Ice and Fire	One of the priests of Saint Reymanaud Cathedral has a certain flair for captivating the hearts of his flock. While most simply drone on about piety and faith, this man of the cloth is adept at using fire and ice to bring vivid life to the stories of the \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03Enchiridion\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03.

They may all seek to spread the word of the Fury and guide Her chosen along the righteous path, but some harbor a burning desire to join the fray, and have gained mastery over combat magicks. Now that the Holy See has called them to battle, they are on the cusp of realizing their dreams.

So as long as it encourages the children's hatred towards our foe and possible recruitment into our order later in life, I see no reason why I cannot pay you a cofferful of coin to meet his demand.	1	386380	4420	391	0	5852425	0	153	10	4	0	2300	2300	93	0	62	80014	918227	110089	56	14	0	10	14	0	18	2	6

I commend them for their bravery, but their serving dresses will provide little protection should the Horde rain fire upon them.

The carpenters of the capital have long purchased lumber from the cutter, bows hewn from his wood contributing to the death of countless Horde minions. Stubborn as he is, our city-state is in debt to the old man, therefore I would commission you to sew a pair of the finest work trousers you can muster, so as to remind him of his home.	1	200232	1040	382	0	5852425	0	153	10	4	0	2300	2300	93	0	62	80014	918230	110089	58	14	0	1	14	0	18	5	6
1114	The Clothes off Her Back	I have received a missive in testimony of a chirurgeon who was the sole survivor of an attack on a patrol in the mountains, saved from her congregation with Halone for reasons only She is aware. The healer knew they would not be found, and her fallen comrades could not walk in Her halls without the proper arrangements, so in solemn duty, she proceeded to slice pieces of fabric with which to wrap around their heads, covering the eyes. She continued her task until she was discovered almost naked by a wandering karakul herdsman. With her recovery and her comrades given a proper funeral, I beseech you to make her a beautiful sash cut from the best cloth so that all will know of her bravery.	1	99389	936	387	0	5852425	0	154	10	4	0	2300	2300	93	0	62	80014	918231	110089	58	14	0	1	14	0	26	5	6

He said 'twas a great wyrm, yet I know too well there would be naught but dust and ash if that rang true. The unit must have been caught unawares. Nevertheless, the brave souls are deserving still of the high Halonic funeral procession for knights killed during the divine task, enshrouded in chimerical felt, and brought home to their families with dignity.	1	397556	4680	392	0	5852425	0	151	10	4	0	2300	2300	93	0	62	80014	918232	110089	58	14	0	10	14	0	18	2	6
1116	Pom Hemlock (L)	A lumber town Hemlock was, as the wealth of trees in the area amounted for a prosperous community. Since its villagers fled, there has been an increase in scavengers from other remote cabins and villages and 'twould be not fair to allow the boughs to be picked apart with not so much as a twig for the war effort. Hence the knights will be sending a team of botanists to reap the abundance of wood before all that remains are twisted stumps, and require gear proper for the job.	1	400464	5200	392	0	5852425	0	153	10	4	0	2300	2300	93	0	62	80014	918233	110089	58	14	0	10	14	0	18	2	6
1117	The Cinders of Modesty (L)	I have discovered that there are nights in Coerthas where the air grows so frigid that once their fires grow dim, the keepers of the infirmary in Camp Dragonhead have been wrapping the fading coals within their sashes, leaving small burns and welts on their stomachs. As provisions do not allow me to give them more wood for their fires, so I would discreetly send pairs of sashes weaved with chimerical felt so that their pride is kept intact.	1	99389	1404	397	0	5852425	0	154	10	4	0	2300	2300	93	0	62	80014	918234	110089	58	14	0	10	14	0	26	2	6
1118	The Goggles, They Do Naught	Lord Jannequinard de Durendaire has a true love for angling, so much so that he was once given a pair of gold fishing goggles encrusted with precious jewels as a gift. Unfortunately, upon reeling in a rather large cloudfish, the slippery bugger smacked him in the face, and his gilded goggles fell down the cliffs into the great unknown. It could have been much worse, with the cloudkin taking him down into the depths, yet it is undeniable that there is no getting the headgear back. I wish to send him a new pair as a get well gift for the welt on his cheek. Mayhap with your talents you can design him more practical ones that will stay on his face in the event of another fin-slapping.	1	109544	572	358	0	5852425	0	153	8	4	0	2300	2300	91	0	62	80014	918235	110089	50	14	0	1	12	0	18	5	6
1119	Not on My Table	One of the newest inductees of hospitaliers has recently experienced the first loss under her care, a frail son of the lord of House Fortemps. The first death is always the most unbearable, yet the Fortemps family allows her no rest, blaming the poor woman for their son's early ascension. She has spent recent days withdrawn in repentant prayer to the Fury, and I wish to help her through the pain by giving her a pair of earrings to soothe her soul and eventually beckon her back to the healing table.	1	109544	572	358	0	5852425	0	154	8	4	0	2300	2300	91	0	62	80014	918236	110089	50	14	0	1	12	0	18	5	6
1120	Halonic Hermeneutics	There is some divergence in interpretations of the \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03Enchiridion\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03, yet all lead towards one doctrine writ in dragon blood. Regarding magic, there are those who believe thaumaturgy puts the clergy's prayer to action, and those who believe prayer alone is sufficient to manifest the Fury's miracles. After the recent incursions by the Dravanians, I tend to favor the \xe2\x80\x9cburn and destroy\xe2\x80\x9d school of thought, and would ask you supply us with staves with which to practice fighting fire with fire.	1	54772	572	363	0	5852425	0	152	8	4	0	2300	2300	91	0	62	80014	918237	110089	50	14	0	1	12	0	26	5	6
1121	Peril Never Wore Safety Goggles (L)	The Disciples of the Land who follow after the Temple Knights are pioneers in their own right. There are bounties aplenty in every ilm of land we take back from the Dravanians, but there are dangers to lessen our ranks, too. Any botanist or angler who traverses uncharted territory must have protection\xe2\x94\x80shoes that can withstand sharpened rock, pants that keep deadly plants off the skin, and most importantly, goggles that shelter the eyes from dragons' foul breath.	1	219088	2860	368	0	5852425	0	153	8	4	0	2300	2300	91	0	62	80014	918238	110089	50	14	0	10	12	0	18	2	6
1122	Heinz's Dilemma (L)	Amidst the chaos of the wounded filling our beds from the Dravanian assault, there has been an increase in the number of calmatives disappearing from the infirmary's cabinets. While I cannot prove thieves to be responsible, the rapidly depleting stock after a single day can have no other explanation. While we try to accommodate everyone, pilfering of the physicks made from rarer ingredients could mean more for black marketeers and less for those who are in dire need. To prevent further theft, one of the younger hospitaliers came up with the brilliant idea to carry the medicines around on their person\xe2\x94\x80particularly on their ears. 	1	219088	2860	368	0	5852425	0	154	8	4	0	2300	2300	91	0	62	80014	918239	110089	50	14	0	10	12	0	18	2	6
1123	Transposing Theology (L)	A priest with a penchant for capturing the hearts of the common people through conjury of ice and fire during his recitations of Halonic scripture has requested two staves for his faithful altar boys so that they may practice and participate in the sermons. Given that his reception by the lowborn has led to increased attendance, I would pay you greatly to provide me the proper wands for thauma\xe2\x94\x80er, religious purpose.	1	54772	858	373	0	5852425	0	152	8	4	0	2300	2300	91	0	62	80014	918240	110089	50	14	0	10	12	0	26	2	6
1124	Sense of Entitlement	A certain astrologian from the Athenaeum scoffed that he of great talents should not waste his time gazing at the dragon star as so many do and demanded a mythrite planisphere in the Sharlayan style for the coming uprising. The dragons roar at our gates and the old fool demands a crackpot tool of a bygone age? If he were not of House Durendaire, he would be made to walk from Witchdrop! Where in the name of Halone am I to procure such an obscure device? 	1	140746	676	359	0	5852425	0	153	8	4	0	2300	2300	91	0	62	80014	918241	110089	52	14	0	1	12	0	18	5	6
1125	High Above Me, She Sews Lovely	The flowers of the capital bloom even in winter, and the lack of sun upon their skin gives them a radiant glow. There is one who has caught the eye of a certain count's son, who has pleaded me to play matchmaker, yet it will be you who will sow the seed of love. For the ladies of Ishgard are known for their beautiful embroidery, and it is my intention to provide the young lass with a needle of such finery that she will return in kindness a handkerchief for the young lord. Will you be able to craft me such a piece?	1	122918	624	359	0	5852425	0	153	8	4	0	2300	2300	91	0	62	80014	918242	110089	52	14	0	1	12	0	18	5	6
1126	Sky Is the Limit	As the Temple Knights' Minister of Coin, one would think I care solely for keeping the merchants of death in business. It is false, however, for I know well that a sound economy means less prayers by the commoners for what they do not have, and more devotion towards the Fury's divine command. With the recent opening of some sky routes, purveyors in the Crozier grow thirsty for what commerce lies beyond the city walls in Coerthas and the Sea of Clouds, and thus will partake in technologies owned by the manufactory to build safer ships. The increasing demand of these vessels calls for mythrite, which coats the rudders that keep the ship afloat, strengthening them against turbulent winds.	1	61459	624	364	0	5852425	0	153	8	4	0	2300	2300	91	0	62	80014	918243	110089	52	14	0	1	12	0	26	5	6
1127	Charting the Trends (L)	The spoiled viscount at the Astrologicum is at it again, and this time he's clamoring for more astromantic planispheres, expecting \xe2\x80\x9can impending thirst for knowledge of the Sharlayan school.\xe2\x80\x9d Bah, I've seen no such trend and besides, I know not a goldsmith in Ishgard capable of making these contraptions of which he speaks...though, a well-traveled outsider such as yourself might have stumbled across the designs in your travels. Do not worry, you shall be paid well\xe2\x94\x80Lord Jannequinard has made certain of it with the clinking of his poor father's coin.	1	281492	3380	369	0	5852425	0	153	8	4	0	2300	2300	91	0	62	80014	918244	110089	52	14	0	10	12	0	18	2	6
1128	Old-school Spooling (L)	While Ishgardian society is more or less accepting of women who wish to take up the sword in the name of the Fury, there are ladies of the manors who fiercely protect their traditional roles laid out in divine scripture, and thus are coveted as women who shine most brilliantly in their elegance, purity, and modesty. They are known to spend their days sewing tokens of their affection for Temple Knight suitors of noble blood, weaving with scented thread that lingers long after their dainty fingers had put needle to cloth. Theirs is a wellspring of morale that cannot be acquired from the rallies on the battlefield, and thus I would send them quality sewing needles to stir the hearts of our men.	1	245836	3120	369	0	5852425	0	153	8	4	0	2300	2300	91	0	62	80014	918245	110089	52	14	0	10	12	0	18	2	6
1129	Hulls of Broken Dreams (L)	Although remote, the airship landings located in the Sea of Clouds and the western highlands are two of the busiest ports in the realm. Camp Cloudtop, in particular, imports most everything to maintain daily operations. Given the perilous journey, the landings regularly receive airships with severely damaged hulls. One such emergency landing saw a ship grounded until the entire hull could be repaired with mythrite, exhausting the dock's entire supply, to which I beseech you to replenish the stock as soon as possible.	1	61459	936	374	0	5852425	0	153	8	4	0	2300	2300	91	0	62	80014	918246	110089	52	14	0	10	12	0	26	2	6
1130	The Unfortunate Retirony	A true knight never exhausts of his divine task, yet when the Hour of the Sheath tolls, those who fought so long on the battlefield must stand aside for fresh blood. Hence it is most unfortunate when an elder knight in years of service is torn limb-from-limb mere bells before his Hour, as was the case with poor Ser Blaine of House Durendaire. Though he has no use for bangles of fending in this world, I shall see to it that when he walks in Halone's halls, She will know well of his deeds.	1	171864	780	360	0	5852425	0	151	8	4	0	2300	2300	91	0	62	80014	918247	110089	54	14	0	1	12	0	18	5	6
1131	Citizen's Arrest	The inquisition unmasked a heretic amongst the astrologians in Camp Dragonhead\xe2\x94\x80a man who whispered secrets into the ears of Dravanian agents at the Steel Vigil. Upon just accusation, the traitor bounded for the gate with a stolen chocobo, and would have certainly made it to refuge had it not been for an elderly porter who threw himself at the bird's flank, causing the heretic to fall from his steed. An immediate sentencing and beheading followed, yet I feel something should be given to the unsung hero who abandoned his post in the name of Halone. Craft me a ring of hardsilver so all will know of his bravery.	1	157248	728	360	0	5852425	0	153	8	4	0	2300	2300	91	0	62	80014	918248	110089	54	14	0	1	12	0	18	5	6
1132	The Monuments Mages	Should the Horde breach our barriers, they would lay waste to our every building and silence our every child. And Saint Reymanaud Cathedral? It would most likely be the first to fall. And while it is true that her walls might be rebuilt, the relics of the great war housed in the cathedral most certainly cannot. The Holy See has decreed the reliquaries which hold these rich pieces of history to be warded in the same manner as the Steps of Faith, though on a much smaller scale. To that end, the arcanists in charge of the project have requested magnifiers so that they may properly transcribe geometric wards the size of a fingertip.	1	78624	728	365	0	5852425	0	153	8	4	0	2300	2300	91	0	62	80014	918249	110089	54	14	0	1	12	0	26	5	6
1133	Life Ends at Retirement (L)	The Hour of the Sheath draws near for three elder knights who have fought bravely for almost two eras. To commemorate the valor of these honored knights and their homecoming to Ishgard to serve on the advisory councils, I would ask you to provide me hardsilver bangles that glisten so brightly that even the spires will know of their great deeds.  	1	343728	3900	370	0	5852425	0	151	8	4	0	2300	2300	91	0	62	80014	918250	110089	54	14	0	10	12	0	18	2	6
1134	Watchers within the Walls (L)	A change of guards for Lady Ninne of Camp Dragonhead has been issued in light of the infiltration of heretics among the garrison. The fresh team of knights shall be sent from Ishgard proper, and are expected to arrive by nightfall. The lady wishes to welcome their arrival with mormorion rings crafted with the sigil of the house they serve, and unless you prefer a lighter coinpurse, it would be unwise to refuse the request.	1	314496	3640	370	0	5852425	0	153	8	4	0	2300	2300	91	0	62	80014	918251	110089	54	14	0	10	12	0	18	2	6
1135	Deal with It (L)	Not only were the outermost barriers of Daniffen's Collar broken, but those that remained are now awash with miniscule cracks, nigh impossible for the naked eye to locate. The chosen custodians of the Steps of Faith are under immense pressure to repair the intricate arcane walls posthaste, and have great need for spectacles able to magnify their vision so that they might see where new wards are needed.	1	78624	1092	375	0	5852425	0	153	8	4	0	2300	2300	91	0	62	80014	918252	110089	54	14	0	10	12	0	26	2	6
1136	Needs More Prayerbell	No sooner had I completed preparations for vespers had I discovered the chamber was bare of a large silver handbell that pleasantly informs the friars of the sacred hour. Objects for use in the worship of the goddess must be crafted in the presence of a church official to ensure the Fury's will is properly imbued into the tool...along with drops of Her humble servant's blood. Such things cannot be freely bought and sold!

1137	The Grander Temple	A House Dzemael architect approached my office with a proposition to rebuild the Congregation Hall from its foundation. I told him that the Congregation was not in dire need of a complete renovation but when he unfolded the scroll and showed me the grand hallways, the marble columns, and the statues of our great modern warriors, my heart was aflutter. Whether or not the plans will come to be, I know not, but I do believe he deserves a pair of dragon fang earrings for his efforts.	1	184032	832	361	0	5852425	0	153	8	4	0	2300	2300	91	0	62	80014	918254	110089	56	14	0	1	12	0	18	5	6
1138	Appeasing the Astromancer	A provisions request came across my desk from the Astrologicum sealed with wax bearing the sigil of Durendaire, and its contents were designs for a goldsmith to create the prototype for a planisphere. I can only guess who the designs came from, and I would have sooner burned the request with my candle if I followed not my first principle: coin speaks louder and truer than any tongue, and Durendaire coin is nothing to sniff at. 	1	96595	884	366	0	5852425	0	153	8	4	0	2300	2300	91	0	62	80014	918255	110089	56	14	0	1	12	0	26	5	6
1139	With a Noise That Reaches Heaven (L)	As I sighed over the repeated pilfering of the prayer-beckoning bell, I had an epiphany of sorts\xe2\x94\x80the soundings of the \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03hand\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03bell were sweet and mild, but a \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03clock\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03bell would be much more difficult to steal, and one crafted in the likeness of Halone's shield, encrusted with sparkling jewels and polished brighter than the sun\xe2\x94\x80now that would certainly heighten the avidity of prayer! Such a testament of the Fury's splendor cannot be had without a large quantity of hardsilver ingots.

1140	Man with a Dragon Earring (L)	I have oft heard that while the artisans of House Dzemael are richly rewarded and are verily masters of their crafts, some feel their deeds are not adequately appreciated by the people of Ishgard due to the absence of shimmering armor and displays of heroism. While it is true that their contributions are made in places far quieter than fields of battle, they are every bit as important to the Holy See as those of the knights. Mayhap earrings fashioned from slain dragons will inspire them to continue their work as warriors of the saw, quarry, and hammer.	1	368064	4160	371	0	5852425	0	153	8	4	0	2300	2300	91	0	62	80014	918257	110089	56	14	0	10	12	0	18	2	6
1141	Silver Bar of Upcycling (L)	If that Jannequinard shows up at my office once more to make a case for the urgency of a symposium on Sharlayan astrology with planisphere displays for the audience, I'll visit the tomb of Saint Guenriol himself to make certain he is not rolling in it. Melting quality hardsilver into such meaningless objects seems to make them destined for the scrap pile anyway, hence I entrust the task to you.

1144	A Halo for Her Head	A scholar of great renown and little time for frivolities will finally complete the sacred bond with her sweetheart in none other than the scholasticate itself. She is a fairly modest woman with little taste for exquisite jewelry, yet I would have you craft me a circlet for the bride to wear upon her head on her wedding day that fits her serene posture and thirst for knowledge.	1	100116	1040	367	0	5852425	0	154	8	4	0	2300	2300	91	0	62	80014	918261	110089	58	14	0	1	12	0	26	5	6
1145	Ring of Reciprocity (L)	The archers of the Chocobo Forest seem fairly adept at picking off the Dravanians that harry our airships, and as a result have saved our supplies on numerous occasions.

It is a war tapestry, forty yalms wide depicting some of the most glorious battles against the Horde, with red thread turning to draconian gore and silver turning to Coerthan snowfall. While we could hardly expect \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03one thousand\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 hands to embroider the tapestry, I imagine it would take thirty ladies of House Haillenarte working from dawn to dusk for at least a year or so, and they will be in need of good gossip and strong needles if they are to complete the masterpiece.	1	400464	5200	372	0	5852425	0	153	8	4	0	2300	2300	91	0	62	80014	918263	110089	58	14	0	10	12	0	18	2	6
1147	It's the Circlet of Life (L)	The greenest field chirurgeons have completed their training and will soon depart Ishgard to join the front lines of battle alongside the Temple Knights. In order to commemorate their first time in the field, I would have you craft them circlets so that if their first mission proves their last (as is the case with most), at least their families will remember them in their finest.	1	100116	1560	377	0	5852425	0	154	8	4	0	2300	2300	91	0	62	80014	918264	110089	58	14	0	10	12	0	26	2	6
1148	Does This Look Infected?	An illness known as the Red Throat has become rife in a low corner of the Brume, and the sight of a man collapsing in the street and vomiting blood has become disturbingly common. We have been able to treat and contain the disease through the use of rubycress root, but supplies are running dangerously low. Travel afar and acquire handfuls of the roots, and you will receive a purseful of coin.	70	0	834	468	0	5581915	5912171	154	3	4	1	2204	2300	97	0	2200	80014	131160	110090	50	67	20	1	18	1	14	5	6
1149	Breathe Deeply	Last services have increased thricefold for the faithful who perish from the Red Throat, a disease that spreads so seamlessly that the families of those who succumbed became so fearful of its wrath so as not to attend the ceremonies of their loved ones. The teachings say the absence of one's kin prevents the deceased to return hastily to the bosom of the Fury. Thus to quell the worries of family members, the Order of the Friars Templar has taken to placing charms wrapped in a tuft of saint's breath upon the scarlet mouth of the deceased, ensuring Her protection for the living so that the last ceremony would be well-attended. After all, it is only those who have not the faith in Her divine will who will be vulnerable to the disease from within the sanctity of the church! The popularity of the service has depleted what little remnants of the grass we had left. We request a botanist to provide us with more tufts of saint's breath to keep up with the demand from bereaved families.	70	0	834	468	0	5581915	5912173	152	3	4	1	2204	2300	97	0	2200	80014	131161	110090	50	67	20	1	18	1	29	5	6
1150	Warm in Their Beds	The fortress that Falcon's Nest will become is to be built solid and impenetrable with materials married to stone and steel, yet House Dzemael has made a rare request for lumber in constructing some building foundations. You may inquire as I did of creating frames of wood as we strive to rebuild Falcon's Nest stronger than before, yet the architects of House Dzemael explained the project was not for the Nest's defenses. You see, the commonfolk of Falcon's Nest lived simple lives, and often gave hope to the wish that they would die aged among family in the warmth of their own cabin beds. The Calamity had denied that wish from those residents of Falcon's Nest who fled in terror, buried and frozen in ever-ice. The Rook expressed its desire to reconstruct the townspeople's homes as they stood, in a solemn tribute for those who had lost their lives.	70	0	769	468	0	5581915	5912174	151	3	4	1	2204	2300	97	0	2200	80014	131162	110090	50	67	20	1	18	1	25	5	6
1151	Secondhand Smoke Screen (L)	A Temple Knight commander reports from the field that he has developed an unusual cough, which I can only assume is an inflammation from breathing the noisome mists that rise from the land during a battle. While the hospitaliers most certainly mean to serve our men well, sometimes I fear the zealousness of their experiments may take a toll on the bodies of our own men over time. Nevertheless, the root of the rubycress plant is just what his ailment requires, boiled into a poultice, applied to the chest\xe2\x94\x80well, the chirurgeon will know what to do. He simply knows not where to find the plant, to which I would pay you for your trouble.	105	0	4994	473	0	5581915	5912171	154	3	4	1	2204	2300	97	0	2200	80014	131163	110090	50	67	20	10	18	1	14	2	6
1152	A Crown for Every Head (L)	These days, the church finds itself busily preparing for the Feast Day of Saint Valeroyant, that legendary dragoon and, as some believe, the patron protector of youth. An outsider such as yourself may be unable to comprehend such reverence, but on this righteous day, it is tradition for the Temple Knights to take to the streets, passing by the residences and adorning the little ones' heads with flower crowns, intricately woven from freshly plucked tufts of saint's breath. Hence as the festivities draw nigh, the order must lose no time in braiding and blessing the protective charms, as there must be a wreath for every child in the capital. Bringing us ricks of the grass posthaste, we shall reward you most graciously. 	105	0	4669	473	0	5581915	5912173	152	3	4	1	2204	2300	97	0	2200	80014	131164	110090	50	67	20	10	18	1	29	2	6
1153	No Rest for the Thicket (L)	House Dzemael beams so brightly of the work their men do on the buildings in Falcon's Nest, that their orders require them to work night and day, for the Rook did not attain such wealth and prestige without their penchant for unrivaled diligence. After the sun sets, great fires must be kept burning bright enough for them to see their work clearly and keep the wild nocturnal beasts at bay. Procure great stacks of wood to serve as kindling for the bonfires so that those artisans of stone and lumber may continue to see sharp through night's thick cover.	105	0	4669	473	0	5581915	5912174	151	3	4	1	2204	2300	97	0	2200	80014	131165	110090	50	67	20	10	18	1	25	2	6
1154	Ladies and Gentians	The infirmaries that treat the Temple Knights are afforded facilities and tools of utmost modernity and our services profit much from the High Houses' grace, though we find it is not coin that we lack. Alas, for too many years had we taken the gentian plant of Coerthas for granted, as the everwinter choked out most of the vegetation, so did the region's gentian plants perish. A simple ingredient for medicines to cure stomach pain was once in the back of our minds has now become a constant worry in terms of supply, and can only be found in the Chocobo Forest these days. Might you fly out to the region and harvest some stock to replenish our cabinets? 	70	0	1062	469	0	5581915	5912185	154	3	4	1	2018	2300	97	0	2000	80014	131166	110091	52	67	20	1	18	1	14	5	6
1155	The Bitter, the Better	Dravanians have no love for the bitterdrake root, which curiously enough does not taste sour on the palate of man. How curious it is that the bane of dragonkind is the very same root which allows Ishgardian babes to grow strong in the womb, as our infirmaries often allocate it to women as a refreshing herbal tea that eases the stress of gravidity. As we have given the rest of our current stock of the root to Master Martineau for use in his experiments, the noblewomen would be sure to pay coin to the botanist who can provide more.	70	0	932	469	0	5581915	5912187	151	3	4	1	2018	2300	97	0	2000	80014	131167	110091	52	67	20	1	18	1	15	5	6
1156	Six Hours in a Leaky Boat	Some time ago, I traveled to Cloudtop in one of the older airship holds with the men during a storm and found it to be a most miserable experience. A Temple Knight of low rank would never complain, yet when I as second commander was subject to the same conditions, I found myself shivering in my armor drenched head to foot as the wooden planks from the ship's hull seemed to drip in every direction. It was then that I gave the order to start retiring the aging transport fleets. While the Skysteel Manufactory excels in creating airships and components essential for battle, the lumber used in the transport models leaves something to be desired; light and durable but miniscule nooks and crevices caused by natural weathering and vilekin infestations make the ships almost completely porous. The engines may do a bit more heavy lifting, but caelumtree root from the Chocobo Forest is far more impervious to water. Procure me a quality stock so that I may send it to the manufactory to build new transport hulls.	70	0	932	469	0	5581915	5912188	151	3	4	1	2018	2300	97	0	2000	80014	131168	110091	52	67	20	1	18	1	29	5	6
1157	Coat the Harm (L)	A dragon claw or chocobo's talon to a soft stomach will speed a man towards his congregation with Halone unless a remedy known as Mother's Mercy is ingested in time. The medicine swiftly coats the inside of the stomach with a thick mucus, allowing the blood to clot and the wound to close. Due to the value in curing such grave wounds, Mother's Mercy is a staple of every chirurgeon's field kit. A knowledgeable botanist should be able to procure large quantities of gentian, the main ingredient which allows for clotting\xe2\x94\x80though they will need to brave the Chocobo Forest to do so, as the plant no longer grows in Coerthas.	105	0	5092	474	0	5581915	5912185	154	3	4	1	2018	2300	97	0	2000	80014	131169	110091	52	67	20	10	18	1	14	2	6
1158	The Sour Patch Grids (L)	A field chirurgeon is expected to engage in combat alongside the knights when the hour calls, yet it is he who must remain the last one standing to treat the wounded. Hence our position focuses more on rendering a dragon's biology to rebel against itself rather than challenging its strength forthwith. While collaborating with Master Martineau to find a poison that could provide aid to our chirurgeons in battle, my colleague and I have conducted field research to discover that dragons avoid one specific plant at all costs\xe2\x94\x80the bitterdrake. They not only take great pains to keep at a distance of the stuff, they also snarl at it as if it were Ishgardian. Gather for us some sprigs of bitterdrake, and take care to leave the oil on the leaves intact\xe2\x94\x80its extraction could prove useful to me and Master Martineau in our trials.	105	0	6392	474	0	5581915	5912187	151	3	4	1	2018	2300	97	0	2000	80014	131170	110091	52	67	20	10	18	1	15	2	6
1159	Hot Tub Clime Machine (L)	Knights spend their lives becoming a single solidified mass of the Fury's divine will, and every inch of the body speaks to that task. Our palms become calloused with the training of the sword, and our backs grow accustomed to the burden of the plate, and our necks stiff and upright in determination. However, if every waking moment is spent in rigid formality, it would allow for fatigue. Thus something as simple as taking a steaming soak in a wooden bath is one of the enjoyable pleasures our short lives can afford us. I plan to commission such a basin to allow the men stationed in the wearying conditions of Coerthas some form of rejuvenation, therefore it must be constructed from wood that can withstand the harsh elements and keep water heated for hours at a time. Lumber from the foot of the caelumtrees in the Chocobo Forest looks to be of durable quality. 	105	0	5417	474	0	5581915	5912188	151	3	4	1	2018	2300	97	0	2000	80014	131171	110091	52	67	20	10	18	1	29	2	6
1160	Your Mother Is Medicine and Your Father Is the Wild	The Temple Knights have succeeded in blazing a path through the Churning Mists, allowing the spoils and bounties of areas once inaccessible to again bear fruit for the campaign. When I learned of this news, I pored over the ancient texts of my trade, and I grow excited with each passing day that lost remedies may soon be regained with the more land the knights conquer. The home of the Dravanians is tumultuous, so I look to employ a true pioneer in botany who would know the sorts of plants that may produce medicinal properties at a moment's glance. 	70	0	1097	470	0	5581915	5912193	154	3	4	1	2042	2300	97	0	2002	80014	131172	110093	54	67	20	1	18	1	14	5	6
1161	Dandelion Don't Tell No Lies	Granted leave to peruse the Temple Knights' vaults for research, I came across a faded letter from a chirurgeon dated one hundred summers past, and its contents have my interest piqued. The medic bore witness to a crisis in which a squadron of knights had been cut off from their main supply route and driven into the arms of the enemy. Fatigued and severely malnourished, they refused to meet death, and fended off the Horde for nigh on a fortnight. The Fury, impressed by the resilience of Her faithful, answered their prayers by raising a single patch of hardy plants from the earth, which upon consumption rid them of all maladies and saw the knights' muscles bulge thricefold in a matter of moments. With their enhanced physical state, it was said they cleaved their way out with pure strength, a single stroke of the strongarm beheading three or four dragons a man! The sketch in the dilapidated letter seems to match the shape and location of the heirloom dandelion thriving in the dragons' lair, and I muse if it is the same as the miracle shrub. Pluck the dandelions from their wicked place so I may be able to extract the petals' essence and decide whether it can stimulate the humours of our men.	70	0	1032	470	0	5581915	5912194	154	3	4	1	2042	2300	97	0	2002	80014	131173	110093	54	67	20	1	18	1	29	5	6
1162	Chewed Up and Snuffed Out	To rise unto victory is to know the enemy, where it sleeps, where it eats, and Ishgard's laws of war say naught about slaying a Dravanian as it feeds, as only a fool of a dragon would eat in the open. Trackers may be able to distinguish the footprints of a variety of beasts and understand their movements, but a botanist with an even keener eye will soon surmise when and where the minions of the Horde have last fed. Venture forth to the Churning Mists and produce those remnants of chewed plants along with the report of where they were found, and knights will be dispatched to take care of the second course.	70	0	772	470	0	5581915	5912195	151	3	4	1	2042	2300	97	0	2002	80014	131174	110093	54	67	20	1	18	1	25	5	6
1163	Exotic Remedies (L)	With the opening of the road to the Churning Mists, there is the tantalizing possibility of plants which exist only in the Dravanian home with remedial properties not yet known to medical science. I can only leave it to imagination as to what exotic vegetation may aid and strengthen our knights until I can acquire living samples to be subject to testing.	105	0	4802	475	0	5581915	5912193	154	3	4	1	2042	2300	97	0	2002	80014	131175	110093	54	67	20	10	18	1	14	2	6
1164	Sacrilege Neutralized (L)	A revered knight bested a particularly large dragon in battle, but in its dying throes, the foe took the knight's calf in its jagged jaws, shredding his armor into ribbons and inflicting a deep wound. Through our miraculous works and the will of Halone has he been saved, yet the mauled leg has become corrupted with evil humours, and grows more infected by the day. In preparation for an amputation, our chirurgeons require the milk in the stem of the heirloom dandelion, which proves an effective analgesic for surgical practices. Produce for us bouquets of the flower so that we may ease his pain and sever the rotting leg.	105	0	4477	475	0	5581915	5912194	154	3	4	1	2042	2300	97	0	2002	80014	131176	110093	54	67	20	10	18	1	29	2	6
1165	Hybrid Theories (L)	You can lead a dragon to poison, but you cannot make it partake of the foul stuff\xe2\x94\x80unless the dragon is unaware, that is. Botanists have been experimenting with hybrid plants that resemble those preferred by Dravanians but are infused with the toxins of the deadly bitterdrake, a plant they greet with hissing anathema for the havoc it wreaks on their bodies. To bring the conclusions to a head, they wish to employ a field botanist to gather samples of plants which are favored by the enemy.	105	0	4477	475	0	5581915	5912195	151	3	4	1	2042	2300	97	0	2002	80014	131177	110093	54	67	20	10	18	1	25	2	6
1166	Heart to Heart	An Ishgardian wedding is nigh, therefore I would ask you to harvest some giant artichokes for me from the floating isles. Why artichokes, you ask? Well, I shall forgive your ignorance just this once, outsider. There is a tale of a humble bride, who traveled with her knight lover to the battlefield because she did not want him to cease his cause in the name of Halone. It was there in the camp that she shirked a flowery bouquet, commenting the flowers were far too decadent and instead took an artichoke in hand. She admired its resilient and spiked exterior that enveloped the plant's soft, pure heart, and she remarked the beauty of Halone was indeed similar to this plant, and thus should be her bouquet. Many Ishgardian brides are so inspired by the tale that there are often requests of the church to place the thistles near the aisles to represent a humble but fiercely devoted deliverance to the Fury.	70	0	1608	471	0	5581915	5912201	152	3	4	1	2116	2300	97	0	2100	80014	131178	110094	56	67	20	1	18	1	15	5	6
1167	Bold and Blue	It is always imperative to keep one's uniform crisp, clean, and free of holes. Knights are known for keeping both their armor and smallclothes immaculate from field stains and dragon blood; however, they cannot prevent the colors of their array from gradually fading due to dirt, wind, and rain. Some say a knight is not fully a servant of Ishgard without his blue arming coat, and thus any fading attire must be replaced as per the code of conduct. Our weavers request a seasoned botanist to make for the Sea of Clouds and gather bright blueclouds, for their petals will be boiled into a dye that gives the garments their signature hue.	70	0	1413	471	0	5581915	5912202	151	3	4	1	2116	2300	97	0	2100	80014	131179	110094	56	67	20	1	18	1	29	5	6
1168	The Anointing of the Dead	Temple Knights who have fallen during combat with the Dravanian Horde are given the most exquisite of funerals, for it is they who have made Her most pleased in their courageous deeds. In preparation for the knight's journey to Her halls, the body must be made suitable for the Fury's presence and therefore bathed in a fragrant oil. In recent weeks, the Order of the Friars Templar finds itself lacking of extract often, and will compensate a kind soul to travel to the floating isles to gather more for the seemingly endless string of funerals for those who perish on the battlefield. 	70	0	1023	471	0	5581915	5912203	152	3	4	1	2116	2300	97	0	2100	80014	131180	110094	56	67	20	1	18	1	25	5	6
1169	Putting on Airs	A hand of one of the Vault's more exalted priests pleads an urgent task, but it is one that must be kept to utmost secrecy. It appears his master has developed quite the taste for deviled colibri eggs during his afternoon meal and by sunset, he is no longer able to\xe2\x94\x80ahem\xe2\x94\x80keep his silence during evening prayer. While the body has natural ways of proclaiming a cleansing of sin, the priest's...natural proclamation...is so overpowering that filling the room with clouds of incense has little effect. I sought advice on this great matter from Master Martineau, who advised the leaves from giant artichokes in the floating isles, when dried and ground into a cup of tea, can serve to calm the offending winds. The hand promised a great reward to anyone who can fetch his weight in giant artichokes for the pantry. Do hurry, as we would much prefer to save the holy incense for more\xe2\x94\x80ahem\xe2\x94\x80spiritual purposes. 	105	0	9603	476	0	5581915	5912201	152	3	4	1	2116	2300	97	0	2100	80014	131181	110094	56	67	20	10	18	1	15	2	6
1170	These Colors Run Not (L)	The Temple Knight standard, with its brilliant azure hue, flies high to serve as a beacon in the heavens to remind Ishgardians that they must ever be vigilant. Banners made pale by the elements must be quickly replaced with ones freshly dyed so that the colors may never fade from view, else our fervor wanes in the Fury's eyes. There is naught but one flower which produces a dye rich and vibrant enough to suffice\xe2\x94\x80the bright bluecloud. Venture to the Sea of Clouds and procure as many as you can so that our banners may be dipped in a valor that withstands the test of time.	105	0	7003	476	0	5581915	5912202	151	3	4	1	2116	2300	97	0	2100	80014	131182	110094	56	67	20	10	18	1	29	2	6
1171	Nectar of the Goddess (L)	I fondly recall when the church would hold an anointing service, whence sweet-scented nectar was rubbed lightly onto the forearms as a way of making one presentable in their prayers. Alas, I wonder if those days are history, as the flower which provided the nectar has been driven nearly to extinction sithence Coerthas has withered under winter's icy grasp. If only a suitable alternative could be found! I wish to employ a skilled botanist to travel to the Sea of Clouds to collect flower samples for me so I might try and revive the service. 	105	0	5053	476	0	5581915	5912203	152	3	4	1	2116	2300	97	0	2100	80014	131183	110094	56	67	20	10	18	1	25	2	6
1172	Watching the Western Wall	While the knights move forward with their plans to set up watchtowers along the western side of the hinterlands, the location appears to be far too removed from any roads along which house caravans can bring necessary supplies.

1173	Bleeding Out	A particularly bloody encounter with the Horde has left scores of our knights fighting for their lives. If we are to save them, we must replenish our stores of a blood-staunching draft, the brewing of which requires the root of a bush called Thaliak's thumb. Go to the Dravanian hinterlands and harvest as many of these roots as you can.	70	0	1306	472	0	5581915	5912208	154	3	4	1	2033	2300	97	0	2001	80014	131185	110092	58	67	20	1	18	1	15	5	6
1174	A Taste of Their Own Medicine	The Gnath will fiercely protect their territory and lack not for ingenuity in their first line of defense\xe2\x94\x80putrid smoke screens that emit fog and indelibly blacken Dravanian lungs when inhaled, forcing such strenuosity on the beasts that they drop from the sky as if boulders were set upon their backs. While the dragons have learned to give a wide berth to the Gnathic miasmas, our knights may be able to ground Horde scouts with our own variation. The Congregation seeks the services of one with knowledge of deadly flora to scour the hinterlands and find samples which will cause our foes pain everlasting.	70	0	981	472	0	5581915	5912209	151	3	4	1	2033	2300	97	0	2001	80014	131186	110092	58	67	20	1	18	1	25	5	6
1175	Blending In (L)	The Congregation has become painfully aware of increased Dravanian activity on the western side of the hinterlands\xe2\x94\x80the mangled and scorched corpses of valuable scouts telling a grim tale of draconian savagery. With their sacrifice, the need for concealed lookout posts has become crystal clear. Until the scouts' thinned ranks are replenished, however, the companies will remain unable to survey the area themselves. Someone unaffiliated, such as yourself, may be able to seek out a suitable location for a watchtower undetected and discern if local resources might be used in its construction.	105	0	6116	477	0	5581915	5912207	151	3	4	1	2033	2300	97	0	2001	80014	131187	110092	58	67	20	10	18	1	14	2	6

While I know not of the reasons why he is unable to secure his own stock, I dare not refuse the request, for it is known that one military chocobo is worth three men on the field of battle.

1177	Thank You for Smoke Screening (L)	The Temple Knights are looking into development of smoke candles that, when lit in proper conditions, will irritate dragon eyes and conceal the movement and numbers of our companies. Dravanians cannot make use of protective masks as our men can, so to utilize the power of smoke is to our advantage. I am certain there are plants in the wild that can be dried and lit to produce a thick enough haze, hence should you have interest in a good amount of coin, the order is looking for someone who can provide them with smoke-producing plants that might serve as viable candidates.	105	0	4491	477	0	5581915	5912209	151	3	4	1	2033	2300	97	0	2001	80014	131189	110092	58	67	20	10	18	1	25	2	6

As expected, House Dzemael went on the offensive and announced the commissioned cargo shipments of stone from House Fortemps would no longer be required as the Rook would open its own quarry in Falcon's Nest within the sennight. Any man knows better than to find himself twixt a pair of squabbling nobles, but I do agree it would do Falcon's Nest some good to rely less on the risks of long-distance transport.

1179	The Road to Pilgrimage	Some hundred summers past, the Holy See decreed twelve towers be built, monuments to each of the first Heavens' Ward. So inspired were the Ishgardian people by the spires' majesty, many embarked on pilgrimages to each tower during the warmer moons. Wind, hellfire, and the pillaging hands of the zealous lowborn have since seen those spiritual citadels reduced to ruin, and now only the Ninth Vare continues its silent vigil. The order yearns to restore the towers to their former glory so the faithful may again bask in the mightiness of the church. Secure slabs of stone to commence the virtuous task of rebuilding, so the people of Ishgard may once again be compelled to walk the path of the holy.	70	0	834	478	0	5581915	5912179	152	2	4	1	2204	2300	96	0	2200	80014	131191	110095	50	67	20	1	17	1	29	5	6
1180	The Merits of Upcycling	I am certain you have noticed the dark stone beacons placed on the sides of the road. They were used when Falcon's Nest was populated by more children than broadswords to light the roads and guide villagers home after toiling the fields. They have, however, been in disuse since the Calamity, and rather than have them merely sit there slowly eroding away, I would see the stone retrieved and repurposed for rebuilding the hamlet. I leave you with the task of dismantling pieces of the beacons to see if we can salvage some of the materials for our current reconstruction.	70	0	639	478	0	5581915	5912180	151	2	4	1	2204	2300	96	0	2200	80014	131192	110095	50	67	20	1	17	1	25	5	6
1181	The Basics of Forgery (L)	The rebuilding of Falcon's Nest will not soon be complete, therefore House Dzemael recognizes it would do well to have its own blacksmith and forge to quickly and efficiently craft the myriad nails and tools required for the reconstruction. Not every building is suited for a furnace that burns hotter than Ifrit's maw, hence the task falls to you to provide me with samples of possible locations where the forge may be established.	105	0	4994	483	0	5581915	5912178	151	2	4	1	2204	2300	96	0	2200	80014	131193	110095	50	67	20	10	17	1	14	2	6
1182	Bloodspot (L)	The church takes great pains to reach out and provide spiritual comfort to men of every class, yet even among the lowborn does treachery fester and boil. I did not see it myself, but an impoverished heretic knelt before the church and cried out that the blood of Ishgard's youth was on the church's hands before slitting his throat and falling forward onto the steps of Saint Reymanaud. Though the friars thoroughly scrubbed the steps after the incident, the taint and hushed rumors yet linger. Hence we raise the call for miners to bring us more stone so that we may replace the steps entirely and wash our hands of this matter.	105	0	4344	483	0	5581915	5912179	152	2	4	1	2204	2300	96	0	2200	80014	131194	110095	50	67	20	10	17	1	29	2	6
1183	Breaking Beacons (L)	Since my arrival in Falcon's Nest, not once have I seen lit the beacons which line the road to the hamlet.

1184	Permit for Destruction of Religious Property	There have been disturbing reports that vandals have carved insults of the Fury into the ruins in the Chocobo Forest.

1185	I'll Show You My Battle Shards	The Skysteel Manufactory has developed a new cannon\xe2\x94\x80one which shows much promise. While Big Bertha is our beloved standard, she is limited in her talents. This prototype, however, provides us with enhanced killing power, for it fires shells containing scores of tiny metal shards and lightning sprite cores, which upon striking a target burst forth into a fan of death, aspected shrapnel shredding scale, flesh, and bone. The metal will stop the advance of the foe, but it is the lightning cores that deliver the killing blow. After the target is gravely gored, the cores shock the heart with such a jolt that it can strike a dragon dead before our knights even reach the beast. Trials on Dravanian corpses have met with much success, and the manufactory is ready to craft mass quantities of the ammunition. We call for seasoned miners to dig out precious chunks of lancite from the cliffs in the Dravanian forelands to commence production.	70	0	1062	479	0	5581915	5912190	151	2	4	1	2018	2300	96	0	2000	80014	131197	110096	52	67	20	1	17	1	15	5	6
1186	Halone's Jewelry Box	Among the dusty tomes of the church library, I discovered a sacred contraption lost to time\xe2\x94\x80a set of complex and beautifully ornate metal boxes intended for none but the most exalted. He would be seated with hands and feet shackled and his head held pointed to the sky, propped up with a tightened iron collar. The only light that penetrates the dark casket is shone through a large star sapphire, set into the top of the box. When the morning light hits the stone just right, it reflects its radiance into the holy man's eyes, and allows him to see a grand vision from paradise. The tome's excerpt said a handful of priests in history have even been given the gift of a vision so holy that their eyes are burnt blue and can see the dregs and impurity of this world no longer! The ornate boxes have already arrived from Ishgard's finest artisans, but I yet require star sapphires large enough to bathe our eyes in Her merciful light. I will pay a hefty price to any mineral hunter who can bring me the largest sapphires in the Chocobo Forest. 	70	0	997	479	0	5581915	5912191	152	2	4	1	2018	2300	96	0	2000	80014	131198	110096	52	67	20	1	17	1	29	5	6
1187	Rose Never Lets Go (L)	O Halone, what have I done to deserve such animosity? I find myself caught in the middle of the nobles' squabbling and there is need to rectify it, else one or the other might curb their generous flow of gold to the knights' coffers! It would seem an ancient site defiled by heretics and ordered to be destroyed by House Durendaire was ancestral to House Haillenarte, and thus under their wardship. The House of the Rose is furious because of the order and demands what rubble is left of the slandered site to be exhumed and brought back to Ishgard for tribute and safekeeping. And here I thought the Friars Templar would be the brunt of my worries. I beseech you, please, return to the site and extract what remains of the relics so that this dispute may be put to rest. I'll pay you double if you stay silent. 	105	0	4767	484	0	5581915	5912189	153	2	4	1	2018	2300	96	0	2000	80014	131199	110096	52	67	20	10	17	1	14	2	6
1188	Forging Lance Base (L)	Lancite, so named for its use in our city-state's weapon of choice, is one of the few ores capable of penetrating Dravanian scales. In preparation for the initiation ceremony for new recruits into the Knights Dragoon, the Skysteel Manufactory has requested a large order of the ore so they, in collaboration with the Order of the Friars Templar, may begin the ritualistic process of forging. Make for the Dravanian forelands and cut out great chunks, and the manufactory shall reward you fairly. 	105	0	5742	484	0	5581915	5912190	151	2	4	1	2018	2300	96	0	2000	80014	131200	110096	52	67	20	10	17	1	15	2	6
1189	Polished Till They Shine (L)	There is a well-known excerpt in Halonic teachings which states, \xe2\x80\x9cIf thou hath not suffered much of battlefields, worry not of the Fury's discontent, for in Her halls may yet be thy sanctuary. Grasp in thine hand a coarse sapphire and paint thy mind with those who forsaketh Her name. Should thy wish be pure, the stone's surface shalt smooth in time, and grant thee a vision of Halone's halls, O Fury's gift, sated by thy wish.\xe2\x80\x9d While the stone resembles a lifetime of \xe2\x80\x9cpolishing\xe2\x80\x9d dedication and prayer, so inspired are the nobles of the High Houses that they never tire of their want for star sapphires fashioned into rosaries and decadent adornments worn from head to toe. Of course, none but the church can provide baubles of saving grace that have been properly blessed (and hence taxed accordingly). I shall pay you in full should you bring me quality star sapphires so that those gentle lords and ladies may be given some salvation from the comfort of their homes, in lieu of joining the battle.	105	0	4117	484	0	5581915	5912191	152	2	4	1	2018	2300	96	0	2000	80014	131201	110096	52	67	20	10	17	1	29	2	6
1190	From Creepers to Squatters	The Temple Knights are considering establishing a checkpoint in the Churning Mists, but needs know more about the foreign landscape. For a successful establishment, an area must have its share of hills and craggy outcrops to provide a watchtower with ample cover, yet flat enough to provide a stable foundation. The Congregation seeks to commission one capable of conducting a geological survey and bringing soil samples for use in a new informative map.	70	0	902	480	0	5581915	5912196	151	2	4	1	2042	2300	96	0	2002	80014	131202	110098	54	67	20	1	17	1	14	5	6
1191	Dreams of War, Dreams of Liars, Dreams of Dragon Fire	As legends would have it, the swords and pikes which brought forth the birth of our nation were forged in the likeness of the Fury's own. Every true Ishgardian knows the holy scriptures speak of dust that falls from Halone's slumbered eyes into the bowels of the realm as She is stirred by the prayers of Her people. It was with handfuls of that sacred sand that the great weapons of the Twelve were created, and it was those weapons that rendered Nidhogg impotent. While the stories speak of Halone's dust, the Twelve's arms are a stark reality, and real swords smelt with real sand. It's quite possible those ancient tools of death were forged with the sand extracted from the outcrops in the Sea of Clouds, which only a miner with considerable skill could attain. The Temple Knights would pay handsomely for handfuls of the sand, as the demand for such weapons would be insatiable were formidable replicas forged.	70	0	902	480	0	5581915	5912199	153	2	4	1	2042	2300	96	0	2002	80014	131203	110098	54	67	20	1	17	1	29	5	6
1192	Talk about Boundaries	The Holy See, while having faith in those who would lay down their lives in the name of Halone's divine task, would trust no other than the Order of the Friars Templar to examine and appraise the value of any ancient relics found in Dravanian lands, as these items belong to the church, and the church alone. An outsider's natural neutrality in such matters may prove useful, and I would ask you to bring back any items of historical note that you may find. I would procure the relics myself, but you see, the very air of the Mists chokes with such sacrilege that it would render me to my knees upon setting foot in the domain of the Dravanians.	70	0	902	480	0	5581915	5912200	152	2	4	1	2042	2300	96	0	2002	80014	131204	110098	54	67	20	1	17	1	25	5	6
1193	All of These Bases Belong to Us (L)	With our knights' recent victory in claiming their first foothold in the Churning Mists, their ambition burns ever brighter to establish more bases close enough to the Dravanians' domain to monitor their activities but distant enough to remain undetected. An opportunity for employment has been extended for a survey of the lands so that we might find suitable locations for these future outposts.	105	0	3502	485	0	5581915	5912196	151	2	4	1	2042	2300	96	0	2002	80014	131205	110098	54	67	20	10	17	1	14	2	6
1194	There's Sand in My Water (L)	While crystals can oft serve as a much-needed source of potable water, when traveling to places devoid of aetherial manifestations, one must rely on existing water resources\xe2\x94\x80including those that do not always exhibit the highest of purities. The sand from the Sea of Clouds has a particular quality which allows water to drain through, removing impurities that may lead to sickness. In the wilds where filthy beasts are prone to drool and piss in watering holes, the properties of the sand are naught less than a godssend.	105	0	3502	485	0	5581915	5912199	153	2	4	1	2042	2300	96	0	2002	80014	131206	110098	54	67	20	10	17	1	29	2	6
1195	History Needs Some Revisions (L)	It would seem the Temple Knights have cleared a path in the Churning Mists near an ancient cavern said to be thousands of years older than our nation's birth. To my dismay, they have begun thoroughly inspecting the reclaimed site without close observance nor approval from the Order of the Friars Templar! It is we who are the custodians of the church's sacred Halonic history! It is we who should be the ones to carefully scrutinize and preserve the ancient word and ensure our modern teachings hold no inconsistencies with those clues of the past. Unbeliever, you are blissfully ignorant to those pieces which may be a key to returning to Halone's embrace. Make for the Churning Mists and secure any relics you may find before any other can take hold of them. In the meantime, I shall write a letter to the lord commander to notify him of this blatant breach of post. 	105	0	3502	485	0	5581915	5912200	152	2	4	1	2042	2300	96	0	2002	80014	131207	110098	54	67	20	10	17	1	25	2	6
1196	Fake-icite	The Rose Knights have relayed a peculiar message that a bright-red ore with the consistency of rare furite has been found plentiful in locations of the floating isles in the Sea of Clouds. The question that arises to my lips is if it smelts as furite, strikes as furite, can it be marked off as furite? I seek a miner who can bring us copious amounts of the questionable ore that our forges may attest to its quality. 	70	0	828	481	0	5581915	5912204	151	2	4	1	2116	2300	96	0	2100	80014	131208	110099	56	67	20	1	17	1	15	5	6
1197	What Goes Up	The Skysteel Manufactory sees in shades of victory, yet in the case of airships, the descent from the skies can only go two ways\xe2\x94\x80gently or violently. The engineers are currently researching an emergency power reserve to keep our airships afloat even after a hull has sustained grave damage, granting more time to make a gradual crash descent and allow our men to fight another day. According to one of the engineers, minerals with intense wind properties could enhance the ship's buoyancy and put less strain on the engine in such an emergency. The manufactory requests pinches of lightsand from the Sea of Clouds' floating isles to use as samples in their prototypes.	70	0	828	481	0	5581915	5912205	151	2	4	1	2116	2300	96	0	2100	80014	131209	110099	56	67	20	1	17	1	29	5	6
1198	Mortarin'	In response to the wyvern attack not long ago, the Temple Knights have begun reinforcing the more prominent structures of Ishgard. In turn, the nobles have expressed concern that, should the dragons attack again, the new fortifications would rain down on their homes, and have therefore asked the knights to consider the construction of \xe2\x80\x9csafe chambers\xe2\x80\x9d below each and every house, within which the nobles could take shelter should the need arise. I expressed my doubt towards this plan, observing that the chambers would merely serve as their tombs\xe2\x94\x80to which they retorted that if the reinforcements were constructed with a light material such as pumice, they needn't worry for their homes. It was at this time I simply stopped caring and agreed to their ridiculous request. Travel to the Sea of Clouds and mine for Dravanian pumice to see the entitled happy.	70	0	828	481	0	5581915	5912206	151	2	4	1	2116	2300	96	0	2100	80014	131210	110099	56	67	20	1	17	1	25	5	6
1199	Fool Me Once (L)	Halone smiles upon us today, for when I showed a veteran miner recently acquired samples of an unidentified ore, he squinted at the rock and excitedly told me it was verily the furite of legend.

1201	A Spire for New Heights	When asked to describe Ishgard, most outsiders will recall the lofty lance-like spires that pierce the very Sea of Clouds. Yet Ishgardians themselves, who routinely turn their eyes to the skies in passionate prayer, pay the centuries-old constructs no mind. Halone forfend if the Horde would happen to breach the gates and thrash large slabs to crumble and fall upon the heads of our noble ladies and their babes, a scenario more likely in these troubled times. The Holy See has approved the Temple Knights' request to fortify Ishgard's most iconic structures, and the project requires reinforced mortar strong enough to allow the spires to withstand a Dravanian's aerial bombardment. Pluck slabs of pumice from the crags in the Sea of Clouds and bring them hither so that they might be used to create such a substance.	105	0	3428	486	0	5581915	5912206	151	2	4	1	2116	2300	96	0	2100	80014	131213	110099	56	67	20	10	17	1	25	2	6
1202	Sticking It Out	Elder members of the Knights Dragoon are known to prefer lances smithed from pommel ore\xe2\x94\x80a hard substance that, while difficult to work, is believed to make the finest, sharpest heads. Unfortunately, the locations of the few remaining veins in Dravania were known only to the Sharlayans who took the information back with them to the Old World fifteen summers ago. If you were to find a vein of decent quality, I would pay much for the material.	70	0	916	482	0	5581915	5912211	151	2	4	1	2033	2300	96	0	2001	80014	131214	110097	58	67	20	1	17	1	14	5	6
1203	Crystal Chronicles	The stained crystal adorning the buildings of the Holy See marks the sincere devotion of Ishgard's artisans in its most beautiful manifestation. While we of the Order do our best to preserve them, time loosens the ancient frames that hold the pieces, leaving them to rattle and chip in the wind. The Holy See wishes to start a grand-scale restoration of these works of art and has cast the locks off its coffers to see the finest materials are prepared for the task. Crystal with the right amount of transparency has been found, but due to the remoteness of the location, only miners with considerable experience are being sought to extract it.	70	0	916	482	0	5581915	5912212	152	2	4	1	2033	2300	96	0	2001	80014	131215	110097	58	67	20	1	17	1	15	5	6
1204	Dragonproofing	I never cease to be impressed by the buildings in Sharlayan, made of sturdy stone and vastly different from the architecture of the Pillars. Ere it was abandoned, the city-state was known for effective fortification techniques to protect their scholars against Horde attacks. Mayhap there is knowledge yet to be found within those walls to fortify our own bulwarks.

1205	Pommeling the Enemy (L)	Our robust trade with the inhabitants of Sharlayan provided us with copious amounts of pommel ore, which on parchment was said to be smithed for peaceful tools to sate the trader agreements (but eventually made its way to the bolts of our dragonkiller ballistas for many years). Following the scholars' exodus, the fountain of metal has since run dry, and we must now search for our own veins of the precious ore. Search the areas around the Daggers of the Dravanian hinterlands for the material. With luck, you will mayhap locate one of the lost lodes.	105	0	3516	487	0	5581915	5912211	151	2	4	1	2033	2300	96	0	2001	80014	131217	110097	58	67	20	10	17	1	14	2	6
1206	Not So Crystal Clear (L)	Halone forgive, this absolutely will not do! The Holy See has ordered a grand restoration of the stained crystal windows of the church, but the last miner I commissioned brought in stained crystal in quality that is much too hedonistic! If excess of white light is allowed into the church, then the eyes of the prayer-bearers will become more focused on the rays reflected on the fairer sex instead of upwards towards the heavens, thus vanity will distract from our faith when the Fury demands the eyes of all men! Bring me the right stained crystal and I shall pay you double what we paid the last miner. In the meantime, I suppose I will send this wasted batch to the inquisitor's quarters\xe2\x94\x80they never seem to decline refuse of the sharp, broken variety.	105	0	3516	487	0	5581915	5912212	152	2	4	1	2033	2300	96	0	2001	80014	131218	110097	58	67	20	10	17	1	15	2	6
1207	Sharlayan Sympathizers (L)	While the inhabitants of Sharlayan held an abhorrence of our war with the Dravanians, the style of their architecture speaks of more than neutrality. Rumors have spread among the denizens of camp about secret sympathies of the scholars towards the dragons, which was written in code on the walls of their buildings. I find these to be absolute rot, and ask of you to bring back pieces of Sharlayan flagstone so I may put such conspiracies to rest.	105	0	3516	487	0	5581915	5912213	151	2	4	1	2033	2300	96	0	2001	80014	131219	110097	58	67	20	10	17	1	25	2	6
1208	Please Halone, Tell Me I'm Still Asleep	Upon discussion with one of the priests of the church, some of the younger acolytes have been creating a distraction by drifting off during particularly heavy sessions of prayer. It appears that inexperienced faithbringers who are not yet in full control of their intense worship can become lost in their minds, eyes rolling and gesturing widely as they fall entranced in their Halonic visions. 'Twould seem that the masters want of something with a sharp enough pinch to pull them back into the real world. I told him nothing brings about a reality-inducing pinch quite like a Coerthan crab tied to a stick, and he seems willing to pay quite a bit of coin for a basketful. 	1	73220	500	488	0	5852426	0	153	4	4	0	2300	2300	98	0	62	80014	918265	110100	50	14	0	1	19	0	42	5	6
1209	The Voice of the Fury	There had been curious rumors in the Forgotten Knight of a farm family on the outskirts of the capital claiming to be channeling the voice of Halone. It is a truly preposterous notion, for common knowledge dictates that only the high clergymen of the church have such a spiritual channel! Worship of Halone of any kind is not considered heresy, so upon a knight investigation, it was discovered the voices were not that of the Fury, but small insects called whisperworms that crawl into ears from bathing buckets and twitch at people's brains. There's no curing this family, but the worms' natural predator, blueclaw shrimp, could be dropped into the well to prevent anyone else from such unfortunate circumstance.	1	76696	500	488	0	5852426	0	153	4	4	0	2300	2300	98	0	62	80014	918266	110100	50	14	0	1	19	0	42	5	6
1210	Dine or Spine	The nobles who reside in Camp Dragonhead have little in the form of leisure that they oft must take it upon themselves to find some form of entertainment.

1212	A Whole Lot of Nope (L)	'Twould seem the city's waterways have become contaminated with whisperworms\xe2\x94\x80tiny creatures that crawl into a man's ears during bathing and cloud his mind, convincing him he is hearing voices. If the worms grow in number, half of Ishgard could be rendered mad. The only way to get rid of such annoyances is to drop blueclaw shrimp into the sewers and pray to Halone that they eat their fill and cleanse the water of pests.	1	115044	2500	498	0	5852426	0	153	4	4	0	2300	2300	98	0	62	80014	918269	110100	50	14	0	10	19	0	42	2	6
1213	Lurchin' from Urchins (L)	A spineball tournament is to take place at Camp Dragonhead, wherein two teams of residents will kick around a spiny lake urchin and see if they can get it into a barrel using only their boots. I can only imagine the look on the head chirurgeon's face the next day, but as they say: \xe2\x80\x9cThe most primitive form of entertainment is watching others in pain.\xe2\x80\x9d	1	50823	700	503	0	5852426	0	153	4	4	0	2300	2300	98	0	62	80014	918270	110100	50	14	0	10	19	0	30	2	6
1214	Loose Lips Heal (Broken) Hips	The injured and broken bodies of knights cannot live with the meager rations of the knights, especially if there is a good chance for survival. Hence I have special permission from the Holy See to procure diets for them that will allow them to return to the battlefield as soon as possible. The three-lipped carp is a fine source of nourishment and I would have the wounded prioritize their strength over prayer, and the anglers bring naught but the plumpest for supper.	1	85622	550	489	0	5852426	0	154	4	4	0	2300	2300	98	0	62	80014	918271	110100	52	14	0	1	19	0	42	5	6
1215	Fish Oils and Forgotten Spoils	As House Dzemael toils to restore Falcon's Nest to its former glory, the carpenters employed seek to restore the villagers' charred furnishings to their former glory. The Rook is known for their obsessions in both detail and practicality, and consultations with surviving visitors tell of using grass carp oil as a veneer to glue pieces of wood together in their armoires. Mayhap you can gather some to abet the restoration efforts?	1	98430	550	489	0	5852426	0	153	4	4	0	2300	2300	98	0	62	80014	918272	110100	52	14	0	1	19	0	42	5	6
1216	Bounty of Sky, Bounty of Earth	If crops could be grown in the soil near Camp Cloudtop, what need would there be to send food provisions? In speaking with a knowledgeable botanist for advice on the matter, I was told that the flesh of the cloudfish could serve as fertilizer to grow a wide variety of vegetables. This claim amuses, as well as intrigues me, and I would ask a formidable angler to provide samples to test the botanist's theory.	1	37714	550	494	0	5852426	0	153	4	4	0	2300	2300	98	0	62	80014	918273	110100	52	14	0	1	19	0	30	5	6
1217	Prayer and Prejudice (L)	I believe not in the nonsense of the ill fasting for the sake of Halone's mercy. While those knights who feel humiliated of their injuries may find spiritual comfort in it, naught but a steady diet will see them back to their duty. I ask you to gather me three-lipped carp so that they may eat well, restore their strength, and return to their duties hale and healthy.	1	128433	2700	499	0	5852426	0	154	4	4	0	2300	2300	98	0	62	80014	918274	110100	52	14	0	10	19	0	42	2	6
1218	Valuing the Vintage (L)	House Dzemael's carpenters, in consultation with the residents of Falcon's Nest, have been working to refurnish the hamlet, its buildings gutted by the fires of the Calamity. The designs most requested seem to be pre-Calamity, when many pieces of furniture were covered in a special veneer created from grass carp, of all things.	1	147645	2700	499	0	5852426	0	153	4	4	0	2300	2300	98	0	62	80014	918275	110100	52	14	0	10	19	0	42	2	6
1219	Eating Like the Natives (L)	Appalled by the lack of gourmet meals for a visiting priest, the Holy See is sending a culinarian of remarkable prestige to Camp Cloudtop to determine what quality cuisine can be prepared with local ingredients. Although rumor has it the woman is so talented that she can turn dung into delicacy, I propose we start with more edible prospects\xe2\x94\x80fetch me a bevy of cloudfish to determine whether the wavekin can be transformed into something palatable.	1	56571	750	504	0	5852426	0	153	4	4	0	2300	2300	98	0	62	80014	918276	110100	52	14	0	10	19	0	30	2	6
1220	Analysis of Paralysis	My counterpart in House Haillenarte has sent me a curious report, noting that the barbarian Vanu Vanu prize the tendrils of the mahu wai in repairing damaged nerves and paralyzed limbs. I know not of this fish or where it can be found, but it may be a rumor worth testing if you are successful in catching a handful of the creatures.	1	111429	600	490	0	5852426	0	154	4	4	0	2300	2300	98	0	62	80014	918277	110100	54	14	0	1	19	0	42	5	6
1221	The Aquariums of Ishgard	A lord from House Fortemps who guides wealth to our strongboxes is also a self-proclaimed naturalist who spends copious amounts of free time flipping through the drawings of dusty tomes, looking for exotic fish of Eorzea to add to his luxurious aqua garden. Whether his collection leads to viable research I care not, I simply seek an angler to stock him with whatever bizarre fauna he desires so as to keep his mood charitable.	1	124584	600	490	0	5852426	0	153	4	4	0	2300	2300	98	0	62	80014	918278	110100	54	14	0	1	19	0	42	5	6
1222	Bearing of the Blue	The day of remembrance for fallen knights is close at hand, and every member of every house has lost at least one of their kin in the noble cause in the name of Halone. House Fortemps seeks to decorate the manor with a display of pride for the thousand years of service their knights have done our capital, and for the temporary memorial have requested wavekin that bear colors similar to the uniforms of the knights.	1	44571	600	495	0	5852426	0	153	4	4	0	2300	2300	98	0	62	80014	918279	110100	54	14	0	1	19	0	30	5	6
1223	Send a Feeling to My Spine (L)	The Dravanians have started using a particularly cruel tactic in their attacks\xe2\x94\x80snapping the backbones of our men and leaving them to suffer until dead. The Vanu Vanu have been known to use the appendages of the mahu wai wavekin to treat paralysis, and I would pay you good coin for several specimens with particularly plump fins.	1	167143	3000	500	0	5852426	0	154	4	4	0	2300	2300	98	0	62	80014	918280	110100	54	14	0	10	19	0	42	2	6
1224	A Win-win Situation (L)	A House Haillenarte noble-turned-naturalist caught wind of my intentions to gift a House Fortemps rival with aquatic specimens not yet part of his collection and demanded unto me that whatever new species his rival adds, he will pay double the coin for three. While I am somewhat beside myself for being caught in the act, it is probably in both of our interests to take advantage of this animosity.	1	186876	3000	500	0	5852426	0	153	4	4	0	2300	2300	98	0	62	80014	918281	110100	54	14	0	10	19	0	42	2	6
1225	Blue of Sky and Sea (L)	The merchants of the Crozier hear tell that blue cloud coral\xe2\x94\x80prized for the beautiful hue reminiscent of the Temple Knights' standard\xe2\x94\x80has become a most highly sought-after luxury item of the nobles of Ishgard, who buy up the material to decorate their personal water gardens and aquariums. If the Crozier merchants are profiting that much from the fad, then I do not see why we could not divert some of that coin to a more noble cause.	1	66856	800	505	0	5852426	0	153	4	4	0	2300	2300	98	0	62	80014	918282	110100	54	14	0	10	19	0	30	2	6
1226	Dining with Dravanians	Now that a path into the Churning Mists has been forged, the infantrymen in the hold have commenced in a survey of the land and how our enemy lives from it. I would have you travel to the area to fish the ponds and rivers for wavekin that may serve as nourishment for the Dravanians.	1	137872	650	491	0	5852426	0	151	4	4	0	2300	2300	98	0	62	80014	918283	110100	56	14	0	1	19	0	42	5	6
1227	Solo Out the Bolo	It is said the dragons breathe malefic magicks upon their ancient scalekin cousins, turning the creatures into mindless slaves of the Horde. Why is it that scalekin are so susceptible to control? Could it be something in their blood? 'Twould be a fool's errand to attempt to capture a turned archaeosaur to learn of its temperament. Naturalists, however, have suggested the brown bolo as an alternative\xe2\x94\x80the latter being far easier to manage and pick apart.	1	151273	650	491	0	5852426	0	151	4	4	0	2300	2300	98	0	62	80014	918284	110100	56	14	0	1	19	0	42	5	6
1228	Pipira Pirouette	The Congregation is preparing a celebratory feast for the formation of the new volunteer militia. However, with the increase in numbers, we have not the coin to treat every citizen to the recipes utilized at the banquets reserved for Temple Knight anointments. We must needs find a bountiful fish that the cooks can use to fill the initiates' plates. Pipira pira ought to be found in droves. Might I ask you to fetch me some?	1	51429	650	496	0	5852426	0	151	4	4	0	2300	2300	98	0	62	80014	918285	110100	56	14	0	1	19	0	30	5	6
1229	Hundred Fins for a Hundred Wings (L)	The hundred fin which swims about the Churning Mists is said to be a favorite of the Horde, and according to the field anglers accompanying the exploration parties, it seems to be the only fish they eat as part of their daily diet. A starving dragon is as good as a dead dragon, so we would have you fish as many of the hundred fin as you can so that their population might be depleted. 	1	206808	3200	501	0	5852426	0	151	4	4	0	2300	2300	98	0	62	80014	918286	110100	56	14	0	10	19	0	42	2	6
1230	Sucking on Face (L)	With the opening of the Churning Mists, more curious fishermen have stumbled upon the terrain unprepared for what lies above. Therefore, the predatory brown bolo have acquired a taste and grown fat on eyes, noses, and lips, leaving the area littered with faceless corpses. Make for the Mists and cull the population of brown bolo before they grow larger and become a pest even knights would have to contend with.	1	226909	3200	501	0	5852426	0	151	4	4	0	2300	2300	98	0	62	80014	918287	110100	56	14	0	10	19	0	42	2	6
1231	Plus One or Two or Three (L)	While a banquet provided by the Temple Knights was meant to be only for those already enlisted in the volunteer militia, it appears that the invitation list has increased threefold upon insistence that families be allowed to the event as well. Everyone enjoys a free meal, I suppose, yet it also means the main dish of pipira pira will need to be tripled in order to feed all the guests.	1	77143	850	506	0	5852426	0	151	4	4	0	2300	2300	98	0	62	80014	918288	110100	56	14	0	10	19	0	30	2	6
1232	Spew Forth and Spawn	The fountfish can spew a jet of water nearly four yalms, and with such force that it can breach the skin and cause injury. We, however, utilize it for a much more useful purpose: the quelling of flames brought on by the Horde. The Temple Knights seek to create spawning pools within the capital walls and request fish that could be used as the first wave of breeding stock.	1	164769	700	492	0	5852426	0	151	4	4	0	2300	2300	98	0	62	80014	918289	110100	58	14	0	1	19	0	42	5	6
1233	They Call It the Kissing Disease	While the flesh of fish is widely known to restore the strength of the ailing, few know that the shell of the yalm lobster can be ground into a poultice and absorbed into the chest, breaking apart the gummy humours in the lungs. As it just so happens, a foul cough has been spreading through House Valentione\xe2\x94\x80as a result of what I can only imagine to be excess affection between overzealous lovers\xe2\x94\x80and I have need of the shells to see the ailment cured.	1	178349	700	492	0	5852426	0	154	4	4	0	2300	2300	98	0	62	80014	918290	110100	58	14	0	1	19	0	42	5	6
1234	Warmer than Wine	If rumors are to be believed, there are fish in Azys Lla known as bullwhips who jump and thrash when but a mere drop of dragon blood\xe2\x94\x80sweet as nectar to their palate\xe2\x94\x80falls in their vicinity. I shiver with delight when I hear this, for it means a quicker way to discern an accused heretic. Could I trouble you to bring me some fresh specimens to test the theory? Do not take pains to feed them. We have plenty of food available.	1	58286	700	497	0	5852426	0	155	4	4	0	2300	2300	98	0	62	80014	918291	110100	58	14	0	1	19	0	30	5	6
1235	Unleash the Hydro Cannons (L)	Upon witnessing the wavekin's ability to cast water through the air, a high-ranking cardinal ordered pools of the recently discovered fountfish placed atop every home in the Pillars, declaring that the fish would save Ishgard from the flames of the Horde. Coin to fund this grand undertaking was diverted from a new Brume orphanage, but the Vault still requires someone to actually catch and deliver barrels of the wavekin back to the capital.	1	247153	3500	502	0	5852426	0	151	4	4	0	2300	2300	98	0	62	80014	918292	110100	58	14	0	10	19	0	42	2	6
1236	Angling for Ailments (L)	An outbreak of boils in the Pillars has caused the demand for yalm lobster to skyrocket. The price of one has increased to that of three, and 'twould seem much more logical to simply forsake the middle man and commission an angler myself to procure the shells needed for medicine. 	1	267523	3500	502	0	5852426	0	154	4	4	0	2300	2300	98	0	62	80014	918293	110100	58	14	0	10	19	0	42	2	6
1237	What Does Not Break Us, Devours Us (L)	My colleagues and I have heard that a fish of unsurpassed ferocity can be found in Azys Lla. The bullwhip, it is called, and but one of the creature is said to be as deadly as a whole school of pipira pira. We believe that this fish will be of great help to us as we do the Fury's work, and blessings be upon he who furnishes us with them.	1	87429	900	507	0	5852426	0	155	4	4	0	2300	2300	98	0	62	80014	918294	110100	58	14	0	10	19	0	30	2	6
