Three great migratory waves later, they are now\x0athe most populous of all the civilized races. They exhibit a relatively\x0amodest physique, both in height and build, and are known for their\x0apeculiarly short, rounded ears. Hyurs are well suited for traveling long\x0adistances by foot, a trait thought to account for their swift proliferation.\x0a\x0aTheir espousal of an eclectic variety of languages and traditions is\x0aa legacy of their diverse heritage\xef\xbc\x8das is their resulting lack of a\x0aunified cultural identity.	0	0	0

Traditionally a nomadic people, the tall,\x0aslender Elezen believed the realm to be theirs by divine right.\x0aUnfortunately, this belief made the eventual appearance of the\x0aHyur in their multitudes akin to an invasion, and a long history of\x0aconflict ensued.\x0a\x0aUltimately, the Elezen diverged into the two clans that exist today.\x0aThe Wildwood Elezen took to the forests to protect their homeland,\x0awhile the Duskwight Elezen withdrew to caves and subterrane, opting\x0ainstead to avoid all contact with any but their own.	0	0	0

Many of these nimble\x0alittle folk hail from the islands of the south seas, where they practice\x0aa simple agricultural lifestyle. It was not until the opening of maritime\x0atrade routes that the gradual migration of Lalafells to Eorzea began.\x0a\x0aNow one of the most well-established races in the realm, Lalafells\x0acan be found in great numbers in nearly every city. Though Lalafellin\x0aculture places great emphasis on blood relations, individuals are known\x0afor getting along amicably with members of all races.	0	0	0

116	Miqo'te\x02\x09\x0f\xe8\x02\xff\x04 \xc2\xa9\xff\x04 \xc2\xae\xff\x01\x03		The ancestors of the Miqo'te made their way to Eorzea during the\x0aAge of Endless Frost, traversing the frozen seas in pursuit of the\x0awildlife upon which they subsisted. Adaptation to a hunting lifestyle\x0ahas fashioned them with a keen sense of smell, powerful legs, and\x0aa tail which provides them with exceptional balance.\x0a\x0aMiqo'te are known to be very territorial, and many individuals tend\x0ato lead solitary lifestyles, particularly males.	0	0	0

The majority\x0aof the realm's Roegadyn belong to the Sea Wolf clan, a maritime\x0apeople who earn their keep on or by the sea, be it as sailors,\x0afishermen, or pirates. Comparatively fewer in number are the\x0aHellsguard, who are known for their more earnest demeanors\x0aand can often be found working as bodyguards and smithies.	0	0	0

120	Midlander		The Midlander clan comprises over half of the total population of\x0aEorzea's Hyurs. They have established themselves throughout\x0aevery city in the realm and lead lives as diverse as their heritage.\x0a\x0aTrained in letters from infancy, the Midlanders are generally more\x0aeducated than many of the other races and clans. Despite the fact\x0athat males tend to be slightly taller than females, there are no\x0asignificant differences between the genders.\x0a\x0aStarting Attributes: STR 21/DEX 19/VIT 20/INT 21/MND 18/PIE 21	0	0	0

122	Highlander		The Highlanders were the first of the Hyur to reach Eorzea.\x0aTheir name derives from their long tradition of building strongholds\x0ain the mountains. Compared to their Midland brethren, the\x0aHighlanders are noticeably larger in build.\x0a\x0aOf late, Highlanders have become an increasingly rare sight\x0ain Eorzea, their number represented almost exclusively by those\x0awho fled Ala Mhigo after its fall and now work in the desert\x0acity-state of Ul'dah as mercenaries and sellswords.\x0a\x0aStarting Attributes: STR 23/DEX 20/VIT 22/INT 18/MND 20/PIE 17	0	0	0

124	Wildwood		For hundreds of years, the Wildwood Elezen have lived in the\x0arelative safety of Eorzea's lush forests. With the formation of\x0aEorzea's governments, however, many Wildwood ventured forth\x0afrom the forests, drawn to the exhilarating cosmopolitanism of\x0anearby Gridania. There is minimal dimorphism between the two\x0agenders, though males are generally considered to be milder and\x0amore chivalrous in demeanor. Among their Duskwight brethren,\x0aWildwood Elezen are referred to as Greens, for their love of the forest.\x0a\x0aStarting Attributes: STR 19/DEX 23/VIT 18/INT 22/MND 17/PIE 21	0	0	0

126	Duskwight		Centuries ago, a number of Elezen sought out a life of peace and\x0aseclusion in the depths of Eorzea's caves and caverns. Today,\x0athey are called the Duskwight, though to their Wildwood cousins\x0athey are known simply as the Greys, after their preference for\x0adarkness and stone.\x0a\x0aThe cave-dwelling ways of the Duskwight persist, with some\x0aamong them turning to robbery and pillaging to survive, earning\x0athem the scorn of their woodland relatives. There are few\x0adifferences between the genders, but Duskwight females are\x0aoften regarded as being the more passionate and unyielding of\x0athe two.\x0a\x0aStarting Attributes: STR 20/DEX 20/VIT 19/INT 23/MND 20/PIE 18	0	0	0

128	Plainsfolk		From the flat landscapes of the Plainsfolk's home islands are where\x0athis Lalafellin clan takes its name. Their distinct hair coloration\xef\xbc\x8d\x0aa myriad of earthy and grassy tones\xef\xbc\x8dhelps them to blend in well\x0awith their environment, acting as an effective camouflage against\x0awould-be attackers. It was the similarity of La Noscea's grassy\x0afields to those in their homeland which drew the first settlers to\x0athe island of Vylbrand and what is now Limsa Lominsa.\x0a\x0aThey are a clever and opportunistic people, and crafty with\x0atheir words. The generally accepted view of Plainsfolk is that\x0athey are a vibrant lot, with a penchant for excessive conversation.\x0a\x0aStarting Attributes: STR 18/DEX 22/VIT 18/INT 21/MND 20/PIE 21	0	0	0

130	Dunesfolk		Perhaps the most unique characteristic of the Dunesfolk is their\x0aluminous eyes\xe2\x94\x80a result of a glossy, protective layer which covers\x0athe pupil, an evolutionary response to their homeland's glaring sunlight.\x0aMany individuals wear a small, traditional gemstone on their forehead,\x0aa symbol of their zodiacal sign. They are adamant about scholasticism,\x0aplacing the advancement of knowledge before all else. Other races\x0atend to perceive male Dunesfolk as introverts who care more for\x0abooks, business, and the prosperity of Ul'dah\xe2\x94\x80a city-state built upon\x0aDunesfolk ingenuity\xe2\x94\x80than the goings-on of the rest of the realm.\x0a\x0aStarting Attributes: STR 17/DEX 20/VIT 17/INT 21/MND 22/PIE 23	0	0	0

132	Seekers of the Sun		The self-proclaimed Seekers of the Sun are the diurnal clan of\x0athe Miqo'te race. Their preference for the warm light of day\x0apervades all aspects of their culture, as is apparent in their\x0adevout reverence for Azeyma, the Warden, keeper of the sun\x0aand goddess of inquiry.\x0a\x0aThey are perhaps known best for their striking eyes\xef\xbc\x8dthe result\x0aof their vertically aligned pupils and faintly colored irises. It is also\x0anot uncommon for their eyes to be disparately colored from birth,\x0aa trait considered auspicious amongst their kind.\x0a\x0aSeeker tribes can be found throughout Eorzea, with large\x0aconcentrations appearing near Limsa Lominsa and the Sagolii Desert.\x0a\x0aStarting Attributes: STR 21/DEX 22/VIT 20/INT 18/MND 19/PIE 20	0	0	0

134	Keepers of the Moon		The nocturnal among the Miqo'te have dubbed themselves the\x0aKeepers of the Moon. Shying from the garish light of day, they\x0arevel in the shroud of night, with most offering their piety to\x0aMenphina, the Lover, goddess of the moon.\x0a\x0aThey are distinguishable from their diurnal cousins by their\x0adarker fur, larger ears, rounder eyes, more pronounced canines,\x0aand longer, skinnier tails. The ritual application of war paint to\x0athe face is still regularly practiced, as it is believed the vivid\x0acolors grant lunar powers.\x0a\x0aAfter a great many summers of conflict with the people of\x0aGridania, the Keepers have finally made amends with the\x0apeople of the sylvan city-state, with some even choosing\x0ato make their homes there.\x0a\x0aStarting Attributes: STR 18/DEX 21/VIT 17/INT 19/MND 23/PIE 22	0	0	0

136	Sea Wolves		Long ago, no vessel or coastal village was safe from\x0athe fury of the Sea Wolves and their maritime brand\x0aof brutality. The mere mention of the clan was enough\x0ato strike fear into the hearts of any who drew their\x0alivelihood from the sea. The Sea Wolves originally hail\x0afrom the islands of the far north seas, where they still\x0asubsist as fishermen and women.\x0a\x0aIt was not until the large-scale deployment of Limsa\x0aLominsa's armada that the Sea Wolves' appetite for\x0apiracy diminished. Now, it is not uncommon to see them\x0aemployed as sailors or naval mercenaries on all manner\x0aof vessels. However, they have never forgotten the\x0aways of their homeland, and still use the ancient\x0aRoegadyn language in their names.\x0a\x0aStarting Attributes: STR 22/DEX 18/VIT 23/INT 17/MND 21/PIE 19	0	0	0

138	Hellsguard		The Hellsguard are a Roegadyn clan with body and mind\x0atempered by the unforgiving heat of the volcanic regions\x0athey inhabit. Believing these mountains of flame to be\x0agates to the underworld, their line has for centuries\x0astood vigil to prevent the passage of souls back to the\x0arealm of the living.\x0a\x0aAs the harsh environs of their homelands produce\x0alittle sustenance, the second- and third-born are often\x0asent forth from their mountain villages, with many and\x0amore making their way to the great cities. It is there that\x0atheir sheer girth and steely demeanors place them in\x0ahigh demand as soldiers and sellswords, allowing the\x0ayoung of even the largest families to surpass their\x0aelder siblings in prosperity.\x0a\x0aStarting Attributes: STR 20/DEX 17/VIT 21/INT 20/MND 22/PIE 20	0	0	0

This, however, has long been disputed, with\x0ascholars citing several distinct differences in the two races as\x0aevidence of decidedly dissimilar roots\xe2\x94\x80the first and foremost being\x0athe enhanced hearing and spatial recognition granted by an Au Ra's\x0acranial projections (traits not attributed to draconian horns), and the\x0asecond being the gross disproportion in body mass between Auri\x0amales and females (again, a trait widely unseen in dragons).	0	0	0

178	Gladiator		Gladiators specialize in the handling of all manner of one-handed\x0ablades, from daggers to longswords, be they single- or double-edged,\x0astraight or curved. A defining characteristic of the art is its emphasis\x0aon diverse combat tactics, training its members to bring their martial\x0askills to bear in any situation. As such, there are practitioners who\x0amarry sword with shield, seeking to defend their fellow companions.\x0aOthers opt for an empty off hand, choosing instead to focus entirely\x0aon their sword arm.

This is why many pugilists are quick\x0ato learn that lightweight gear allowing for maximum agility ensures them\x0abetter success in battle than does cumbersome plate or chain.	0	0	0

A wand or cane\x0amade from unworked wood is then utilized to focus the aether until it\x0amanifests as the desired spell. The seat of the Conjurers' Guild lies at\x0aStillglade Fane in Gridania, where the voices of Eorzea's elementals are\x0asaid to be most powerful.	0	0	0

640	Midlander		The Midlander clan comprises over half of the total population of\x0aEorzea's Hyurs. They have established themselves throughout\x0aevery city in the realm and lead lives as diverse as their heritage.\x0a\x0aTrained in letters from infancy, the Midlanders are generally more\x0aeducated than many of the other races and clans. Despite the fact\x0athat males tend to be slightly taller than females, there are no\x0asignificant differences between the genders.	0	0	0
641				0	0	0
642	Highlander		The Highlanders were the first of the Hyur to reach Eorzea.\x0aTheir name derives from their long tradition of building strongholds\x0ain the mountains. Compared to their Midland brethren, the\x0aHighlanders are noticeably larger in build.\x0a\x0aOf late, Highlanders have become an increasingly rare sight\x0ain Eorzea, their number represented almost exclusively by those\x0awho fled Ala Mhigo after its fall and now work in the desert\x0acity-state of Ul'dah as mercenaries and sellswords.	0	0	0

644	Wildwood		For hundreds of years, the Wildwood Elezen have lived in the\x0arelative safety of Eorzea's lush forests. With the formation of\x0aEorzea's governments, however, many Wildwood ventured forth\x0afrom the forests, drawn to the exhilarating cosmopolitanism of\x0anearby Gridania. There is minimal dimorphism between the two\x0agenders, though males are generally considered to be milder and\x0amore chivalrous in demeanor. Among their Duskwight brethren,\x0aWildwood Elezen are referred to as Greens, for their love of the forest.	0	0	0

646	Duskwight		Centuries ago, a number of Elezen sought out a life of peace and\x0aseclusion in the depths of Eorzea's caves and caverns. Today,\x0athey are called the Duskwight, though to their Wildwood cousins\x0athey are known simply as the Greys, after their preference for\x0adarkness and stone.\x0a\x0aThe cave-dwelling ways of the Duskwight persist, with some\x0aamong them turning to robbery and pillaging to survive, earning\x0athem the scorn of their woodland relatives. There are few\x0adifferences between the genders, but Duskwight females are\x0aoften regarded as being the more passionate and unyielding of\x0athe two.	0	0	0

Their distinct hair coloration\xef\xbc\x8d\x0aa myriad of earthy and grassy tones\xef\xbc\x8dhelps them to blend in well\x0awith their environment, acting as an effective camouflage against\x0awould-be attackers. It was the similarity of La Noscea's grassy\x0afields to those in their homeland which drew the first settlers to\x0athe island of Vylbrand and what is now Limsa Lominsa.\x0a\x0aThey are a clever and opportunistic people, and crafty with\x0atheir words. The generally accepted view of Plainsfolk is that\x0athey are a vibrant lot, with a penchant for excessive conversation.	0	0	0

650	Dunesfolk		Perhaps the most unique characteristic of the Dunesfolk is their\x0aluminous eyes\xe2\x94\x80a result of a glossy, protective layer which covers\x0athe pupil, an evolutionary response to their homeland's glaring sunlight.\x0aMany individuals wear a small, traditional gemstone on their forehead,\x0aa symbol of their zodiacal sign. They are adamant about scholasticism,\x0aplacing the advancement of knowledge before all else. Other races\x0atend to perceive male Dunesfolk as introverts who care more for\x0abooks, business, and the prosperity of Ul'dah\xe2\x94\x80a city-state built upon\x0aDunesfolk ingenuity\xe2\x94\x80than the goings-on of the rest of the realm.	0	0	0

652	Seekers of the Sun		The self-proclaimed Seekers of the Sun are the diurnal clan of\x0athe Miqo'te race. Their preference for the warm light of day\x0apervades all aspects of their culture, as is apparent in their\x0adevout reverence for Azeyma, the Warden, keeper of the sun\x0aand goddess of inquiry.\x0a\x0aThey are perhaps known best for their striking eyes\xef\xbc\x8dthe result\x0aof their vertically aligned pupils and faintly colored irises. It is also\x0anot uncommon for their eyes to be disparately colored from birth,\x0aa trait considered auspicious amongst their kind.\x0a\x0aSeeker tribes can be found throughout Eorzea, with large\x0aconcentrations appearing near Limsa Lominsa and the Sagolii Desert.	0	0	0

654	Keepers of the Moon		The nocturnal among the Miqo'te have dubbed themselves the\x0aKeepers of the Moon. Shying from the garish light of day, they\x0arevel in the shroud of night, with most offering their piety to\x0aMenphina, the Lover, goddess of the moon.\x0a\x0aThey are distinguishable from their diurnal cousins by their\x0adarker fur, larger ears, rounder eyes, more pronounced canines,\x0aand longer, skinnier tails. The ritual application of war paint to\x0athe face is still regularly practiced, as it is believed the vivid\x0acolors grant lunar powers.\x0a\x0aAfter a great many summers of conflict with the people of\x0aGridania, the Keepers have finally made amends with the\x0apeople of the sylvan city-state, with some even choosing\x0ato make their homes there.	0	0	0

656	Sea Wolves		Long ago, no vessel or coastal village was safe from\x0athe fury of the Sea Wolves and their maritime brand\x0aof brutality. The mere mention of the clan was enough\x0ato strike fear into the hearts of any who drew their\x0alivelihood from the sea. The Sea Wolves originally hail\x0afrom the islands of the far north seas, where they still\x0asubsist as fishermen and women.\x0a\x0aIt was not until the large-scale deployment of Limsa\x0aLominsa's armada that the Sea Wolves' appetite for\x0apiracy diminished. Now, it is not uncommon to see them\x0aemployed as sailors or naval mercenaries on all manner\x0aof vessels. However, they have never forgotten the\x0aways of their homeland, and still use the ancient\x0aRoegadyn language in their names.	0	0	0

658	Hellsguard		The Hellsguard are a Roegadyn clan with body and mind\x0atempered by the unforgiving heat of the volcanic regions\x0athey inhabit. Believing these mountains of flame to be\x0agates to the underworld, their line has for centuries\x0astood vigil to prevent the passage of souls back to the\x0arealm of the living.\x0a\x0aAs the harsh environs of their homelands produce\x0alittle sustenance, the second- and third-born are often\x0asent forth from their mountain villages, with many and\x0amore making their way to the great cities. It is there that\x0atheir sheer girth and steely demeanors place them in\x0ahigh demand as soldiers and sellswords, allowing the\x0ayoung of even the largest families to surpass their\x0aelder siblings in prosperity.	0	0	0

660	Raen		Auri creation myth tells of a Dawn Father and a\x0aDusk Mother from whom all Au Ra are descended.\x0aThe Raen believe their veins to run thick with the\x0ablood of the former\xe2\x94\x80their brilliant white scales and\x0airon wills serving as proof of this divine lineage.\x0a\x0aUnlike their sister clan, the Xaela, who bloody the\x0aland with endless tribal conflict, the Raen have\x0aembraced a life of tranquility and solitude, long\x0aabandoning the nomadic lifestyle of their ancestors\x0ato settle the deep valleys of Othard's mountainous\x0aeastern reaches. Only on rare occasions will one\x0aemerge from the valley mists to seek adventure\x0ain realms afar.	0	0	0

1980	Limsa Lominsa		On the southern coast of the island of Vylbrand, under the shadow of\x0aancient cliffs worn by the relentless onslaught of the Rhotano Sea,\x0alies the thalassocracy of Limsa Lominsa. Its economy is driven\x0aprimarily by shipping, but boasts lucrative shipbuilding, fishing, and\x0asmithing industries as well. To maintain the safety of its maritime\x0aroutes, the city employs a formidable navy known as the Knights\x0aof the Barracuda. Even so, pirate bands run rampant in nearby waters,\x0areaving and pillaging.	0	0	0
1981	Gridania		In the eastern reaches of the Aldenard landmass, home to vast, dense\x0awoodlands and coursing rivers, lies the forest nation of Gridania. The\x0acityscape is a mosaic of labyrinthine waterways and great wooden\x0astructures, so gracefully constructed they seem a part of the\x0asurrounding environment. The favored goddess of the citizenry is\x0aNophica, the Matron, but great faith is also placed in the wisdom of\x0athe Seedseers\xef\xbc\x8dyoung oracles who guide the nation based on the\x0awill of the forest's elementals.	0	0	0

Ul'dahn culture is known for its\x0aaffluence, and the wealth of the nation comes in large part from its\x0aabundant mineral resources and clothcrafting industry. Though it is\x0athe sultana who claims sovereignty, true power is wielded by the\x0aSyndicate, a council sat by six of Ul'dah's most elite and influential.\x0aNald'thal is the nation's patron deity, and two great halls devoted to\x0aHis two aspects lie in the east and west of the city.	0	0	0
