1	company chocobo	company chocobos	Summon your Grand Company-issued battle chocobo.	Born and bred in the city-state of Ishgard, the majority of company chocobos are geldings of the rouncey variety; however, massive destriers and miniature Belah'dian jennets are also raised to accommodate the builds of Roegadyn and\x02\x10\x01\x03Lalafell riders respectively.	Chocobos are stout-\x02\x10\x01\x03hearted creatures, but\x02\x10\x01\x03they have their limits.\x02\x10\x01\x03  - Mimigun	0	0	0	1	0	0	SE_Bt_Etc_ChocoboWhistle	SE_Bt_Etc_ChocoboWhistle_only	SE_Bt_Etc_ChocoboBye	1	1.05	0.6	0.9	1.1	1.08	0.9	1	0.6	0.85	1.1	0.82	1	65536	65536	65537	0	2	374	0	62	4401	0	2	45	15	20	20	1	100	0	0	0	0	1

Traded for a song by the High Satrap of a distant land, the secret to taming these creatures once thought to be unbreakable was introduced to Eorzea by a mysterious wandering minstrel who journeyed through the realm in the final\x02\x10\x01\x03days before the Calamity.

In the five years following your sudden disappearance from the Carteneau Flats, your ever-faithful chocobo spent each waking moment galloping across the realm in search of his lost master. His myriad adventures are nothing less than fantastical\x02\x10\x01\x03and heartbreaking...but that is\x02\x10\x01\x03a story for another day.

Not long ago, Eorzean unicorns numbered in the thousands, and could oft be seen roaming the Coerthas highlands in great majestic herds that would render the mountains white as snow.

Immediately following the Calamity, an adventurer returning to Gridania from Falcon's Nest in Coerthas happened upon a den of baby behemoths who had lost their mother to Bahamut's flames.

Training a cavalry drake is a long and arduous process that begins the moment the scalekin hatches. Never allowed to see its mother, the creature is raised solely in the presence of a drake whisperer while being weaned on the incendiary glands of aged battle\x02\x10\x01\x03drakes to ensure it is both\x02\x10\x01\x03submissive and deadly.

It only took a few heated skirmishes with the allied city-states for Garlemald to realize that the magicks wielded by the realm's mages were too much for even the thickest of magitek armor plating.

While it is no secret that it was the enigmatic Ascians who provided the beast tribes with nightmares, their reasons for doing so remain shrouded in mystery.
