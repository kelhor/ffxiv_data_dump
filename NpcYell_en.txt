2384	To accelerate, press and hold the \x02\x13\x06\xfe\xff\xff{\x1a\x03Move Forward\x02\x13\x02\xec\x03 key.	1	5	3383	2	5	1

2388	Scattered throughout the course are \x02\x13\x06\xfe\xff\xff{\x1a\x03magicked panels\x02\x13\x02\xec\x03 which bestow various effects when triggered.	1	5	3383	2	5	1
2389	Your chocobo gained a temporary burst of speed! However, be warned: not all panels bestow beneficial effects!	1	5	3383	2	5	1
2390	In addition to magicked panels, you may come across treasure coffers containing \x02\x13\x06\xfe\xff\xff{\x1a\x03race items\x02\x13\x02\xec\x03.	1	5	3383	2	5	1

2409	Here you can practice the basics of chocobo racing.	1	5	3383	2	5	1
2410	Continue to accelerate and observe the effects. Once your chocobo's stamina is completely depleted, your speed will drop, and you will no longer be able to accelerate.	1	5	3383	2	5	1
2411	To alleviate this condition, release the \x02\x13\x06\xfe\xff\xff{\x1a\x03Move Forward\x02\x13\x02\xec\x03 key and allow your chocobo to rest.	1	5	3383	2	5	1
2412	Press the \x02\x13\x06\xfe\xff\xff{\x1a\x03Move Left\x02\x13\x02\xec\x03 and \x02\x13\x06\xfe\xff\xff{\x1a\x03Move Right\x02\x13\x02\xec\x03 keys to steer your chocobo from one side of the course to the other.	1	5	3383	2	5	1
2413	To trigger a magicked panel, steer your chocobo towards it.	1	5	3383	2	5	1
2414	In addition to steering away from panels, you can also \x02\x13\x06\xfe\xff\xff{\x1a\x03jump\x02\x13\x02\xec\x03 to avoid them.	1	5	3383	2	5	1
2415	Some treasure coffers will be suspended in mid-air, so to obtain the race items within, you will need to jump.	1	5	3383	2	5	1
2416	This concludes the chocobo racing training course.	1	5	3383	2	5	1
2417	You may repeat this course at any time should you wish to review the fundamentals.	1	5	3383	2	5	1

2421	To alleviate this condition, stop accelerating and allow your chocobo to rest.	1	5	3383	2	5	1
