1004	The reception will conclude shortly.
1005	Ladies and gentlemen\xe2\x80\x94and any others who may not fall into said categories!
1006	I welcome you one and all to the Ceremony of Eternal Bonding, kupo!
1007	Let us watch in silent reverence as \x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x02\x03 and \x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x03\x03 make their entrance into this most holy of halls.
1008	Was that not the most beautiful thing you've ever seen? It was the most beautiful thing \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03I've\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 ever seen\xe2\x80\x94and I've seen a lot of these, kupo!
1009	If anything can top that entrance, it would probably be an emotional exchange of vows...
1010	If our lovely couple would be so kind as to approach the dais for the ring exchange...
1011	For what would a bonding ceremony be without a bond, er...band?
1012	Ahem! \x02,\x0d\xff\x07\x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x02\x03\xff\x02 \x02\x03 here has toiled day and night, night and day\xe2\x94\x80give or take a few days and nights\xe2\x94\x80to create a truly \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03unique\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 symbol of \x02\x08\x0f\xe4\xe8\x04\x01\xff\x04his\xff\x04her\x03 devotion.
1013	Ahem! \x02,\x0d\xff\x07\x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x02\x03\xff\x02 \x02\x03 has called upon a trusted companion to craft the ring \x02\x08\x0e\xe4\xe8\x04\x01\xff\x03he\xff\x04she\x03 brings today.
1014	Ahem! \x02,\x0d\xff\x07\x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x02\x03\xff\x02 \x02\x03 has traveled the realm in search of the perfect ring with which to express \x02\x08\x0f\xe4\xe8\x04\x01\xff\x04his\xff\x04her\x03 devotion.
1015	Ahem! \x02,\x0d\xff\x07\x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x02\x03\xff\x02 \x02\x03 brings with \x02\x08\x0f\xe4\xe8\x04\x01\xff\x04him\xff\x04her\x03 a ring which is special in more ways than one.
1016	And then we have \x02,\x0d\xff\x07\x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x03\x03\xff\x02 \x02\x03's ring.
1017	And then we have \x02,\x0d\xff\x07\x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x03\x03\xff\x02 \x02\x03's ring.
1018	And then we have \x02,\x0d\xff\x07\x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x03\x03\xff\x02 \x02\x03's ring.
1019	And then we have \x02,\x0d\xff\x07\x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x03\x03\xff\x02 \x02\x03's ring.
1020	Over hill and dale, across ocean and desert, through snowstorm and rain, over hill and...er...
1021	The point is, kupo: our couple journeyed many malms to earn the blessings of the Twelve, proving their resolve in so doing! 
1022	And though the Sanctum somehow neglected to vest any official power in this humble choir moogle...
1023	I'll gladly pronounce the two of you bonded for all eternity, kupo!
1024	Come on, now\xe2\x94\x80give them a nice round of applause! They've earned it, kupo!
1025	The remainder of your time in the chapel is yours to fill however you wish. Just be careful not to spill any beverages on the carpets because it'll be muggins here who has to scrub that out, kupo!
1026	I am pained to inform you that it is\xe2\x94\x80as the jolly innkeepers put it\xe2\x94\x80closing time.
1027	You are, by no means, required to go home...
1028	Let us shower our good friends with joy, happiness, and inexpensive party goods\xe2\x94\x80available from our own outfitters\xe2\x94\x80as they step out of this blessed sanctuary and into their new lives!
1029	Welcome dear friends and loved ones.
1030	We are gathered here today to join two kindred souls in holy union.
1031	\x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x02\x03 and \x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x03\x03.
1032	Here, in the presence of gods and men, they shall take a solemn oath to endure all future trials as one. Supporting the other, should they falter. Guiding the other, should they lose their way.
1033	Therefore, this binding of two souls, which is commended to be honorable amongst all, must not be entered into lightly, but with sincerity and reverence.
1034	While none may deny the spiritual bond twixt hearts intertwined, the gods do ask that a symbol be offered\xe2\x94\x80a token to serve as a tangible reminder of the promise made.
1035	Let us raise up these tokens of our couple's commitment, that the Twelve might pass judgment upon them.
1036	\x02,\x0d\xff\x07\x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x02\x03\xff\x02 \x02\x03\xe2\x94\x80like the Builder Himself, you have embraced creation, and with thine own hands fashioned a ring the likes of which none have heretofore seen.
1037	\x02,\x0d\xff\x07\x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x02\x03\xff\x02 \x02\x03\xe2\x94\x80Menphina teaches us that our worth is measured not only by the love we receive, but by the love we give. The ring you bring today serves as a testament to that love.
1038	\x02,\x0d\xff\x07\x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x02\x03\xff\x02 \x02\x03\xe2\x94\x80as the Traders teach, our lives are an everlasting circle of exchange, not unlike the ring for which you have bartered.
1039	\x02,\x0d\xff\x07\x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x02\x03\xff\x02 \x02\x03\xe2\x94\x80like the path of the Wanderer, some roads are more winding than first they appear. Such is the road your ring has taken.
1040	\x02,\x0d\xff\x07\x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x03\x03\xff\x02 \x02\x03\xe2\x94\x80the Scholar provides us with such knowledge as would allow us to bend the world to our will. You have used this knowledge to create a ring most wondrous.
1041	\x02,\x0d\xff\x07\x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x03\x03\xff\x02 \x02\x03\xe2\x94\x80the Warden embraces all truths, yet She values none more highly than the truth which two friends share. Verily, the ring you have brought today is a true symbol of friendship.
1042	\x02,\x0d\xff\x07\x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x03\x03\xff\x02 \x02\x03. The Navigator guides us all unto that which we seek. Thus did you happen upon this ring.
1043	\x02,\x0d\xff\x07\x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x03\x03\xff\x02 \x02\x03. As the Spinner weaves our fates, so too does She weave the fates of all creation. The ring you have brought for your partner was meant for this day from the first.
1044	Though fraught with peril, the journey our couple embarked upon to see their rings blessed has brought them closer than they could e'er imagine.
1045	Never will they forget the trials they overcame together. Never will they forget the bonds they forged.
1046	By the power vested in me by the gods on high...
1047	I now pronounce you bonded for eternity!
1048	Now, dear friends, let us give the happy couple a warm round of applause!
1049	Please use your remaining time in the Ivory Chapel as you wish.
1050	Plead as we might, the Keeper stalls the hands of time for no soul.
1051	And so with this we must bring today's ceremony to a close.
1052	A journey that will see \x02,\x0d\xff\x07\x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x02\x03\xff\x02 \x02\x03 and \x02,\x0d\xff\x07\x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x03\x03\xff\x02 \x02\x03 to places that they never imagined.
1053	Greetings friends. Your presence at this joyous occasion is much appreciated.
1054	Without further ado, let us see our couple to the dais.
1055	Enter, \x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x02\x03, \x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x03\x03.
1056	Those gathered here today shall serve as witnesses to this sacred bond.
1057	So that none may ever deny it.
1058	And what tokens of loyalty and companionship do these two offer each other?
1059	What symbols of affection will they carry with them always in their hearts and on their hands?
1060	\x02,\x0d\xff\x07\x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x02\x03\xff\x02 \x02\x03 has toiled long to craft this flawless band.
1061	\x02,\x0d\xff\x07\x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x02\x03\xff\x02 \x02\x03 oversaw the creation of this flawless band.
1062	\x02,\x0d\xff\x07\x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x02\x03\xff\x02 \x02\x03 has brought today this flawless band.
1063	\x02,\x0d\xff\x07\x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x02\x03\xff\x02 \x02\x03 presents this special ring and the untold history it carries.
1064	\x02,\x0d\xff\x07\x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x03\x03\xff\x02 \x02\x03 has called upon \x02\x08\x0f\xe4\xe8\x05\x01\xff\x04his\xff\x04her\x03 inner talents to forge \x02\x08\x0f\xe4\xe8\x05\x01\xff\x04his\xff\x04her\x03 partner's ring.
1065	\x02,\x0d\xff\x07\x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x03\x03\xff\x02 \x02\x03 has called upon a trusted companion to create \x02\x08\x0f\xe4\xe8\x05\x01\xff\x04his\xff\x04her\x03 partner's ring.
1066	\x02,\x0d\xff\x07\x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x03\x03\xff\x02 \x02\x03 has reached deep to procure \x02\x08\x0f\xe4\xe8\x05\x01\xff\x04his\xff\x04her\x03 partner's ring.
1067	\x02,\x0d\xff\x07\x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x03\x03\xff\x02 \x02\x03 has chosen this unique band for reasons known only to \x02\x08\x1e\xe4\xe8\x05\x01\xff\x0bhe and his\xff\x0cshe and her\x03 partner alone.
1068	The challenges our couple faced to prepare the rings for this day were not without peril.
1069	Yet they overcame each and every obstacle hand in hand as one.
1070	By the authority granted me by the Sanctum of the Twelve...
1071	I now pronounce you bonded for eternity.
1072	Let us congratulate the newly bonded couple with a heartfelt round of applause.
1073	The time remaining in the Ivory Chapel is your own. Feel free to celebrate this momentous occasion in any manner you see fit.
1074	While I know none could wish the end of such a spectacular day...
1075	The Sanctum must ready its hallowed halls for another.
1076	Now let us bid farewell to our friends as they set out not as two, but as one.
1077	Have all preparations been completed?
1078	Yes
1079	No
1080	\x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x02\x03 and \x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x03\x03...
1081	With the exchange of rings, you will enter a pact not lightly broken.
1082	Ceremony Setting Confirmation\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x13\x06\xfe\xff\xff{\x1a\x03\xe2\x80\xbbThe ceremony will automatically begin 20 minutes after settings have been finalized.\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03The eternity bell may be used to commence the ceremony early, but please ensure all parties have arrived before doing so.\x02\x13\x02\xec\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03\x02\x10\x01\x03Select whose settings are to be used:

1084	Your partner's
1085	Cancel
1086	Proceed to the next stage of the ceremony?
1087	Conclude the ceremony?
1088	Our most lovely couple.
1089	Honored couple...
1090	If you are both ready, let us not linger here overlong.
1091	If anything can top that entrance, it would probably be an emotional exchange of vows...
1092	Therefore, this bonding of two souls, which is commended to be honorable amongst all, must not be entered into lightly, but with sincerity and reverence.
1093	So that none may ever deny it.
1094	...which, as luck would have it, our couple has prepared for us all! You \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03have\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 prepared some...right?
1095	If there is any person here present who might show just cause as to why this couple should not be so joined, let them speak now or forever hold their peace. If there is none, then allow our couple to read aloud their prepared vows.
1096	However, before we proceed to the exchanging of rings, I shall allow the couple a moment to read their vows.
1097	...which I'm assuming you've prepared...right?
1098	As there are none here present who might show just cause as to why the two of you should not be bound unto one another, you may proceed to read aloud your prepared vows.
1099	However, before we proceed to the exchanging of rings, I shall allow you a moment to read your vows.
1100	If there is another like it in the entire realm, it is purely by coincidence!
1101	For \x02,\x0d\xff\x07\x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x03\x03\xff\x02 \x02\x03's sake, let us hope \x02\x08\x0e\xe4\xe8\x04\x01\xff\x03he\xff\x04she\x03 doesn't trust that companion \x02\x1a\x02\x02\x03too\x02\x1a\x02\x01\x03 much, kupo!
1102	And by divine providence, they were not sold out, kupo!
1103	So special, in fact, that \x02\x08\x0e\xe4\xe8\x04\x01\xff\x03he\xff\x04she\x03 wouldn't even tell me why, kupo!
1104	Crafted with \x02\x08\x0f\xe4\xe8\x05\x01\xff\x04his\xff\x04her\x03 own two hands\xe2\x94\x80each strike of the chaser hammer a declaration of everlasting faith, kupo!

1106	A dazzling specimen that could not have been easy to come by, kupo.
1107	A ring whose deep personal significance is probably better explained by \x02,\x0d\xff\x07\x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x03\x03\xff\x02 \x02\x03 \x02\x08\x0f\xe4\xe8\x05\x01\xff\x04him\xff\x04her\x03self, kupo.
1108	And of this token, the Twelve approve.
1109	And of this token, the Twelve approve.
1110	And of this token, the Twelve approve.
1111	And of this token, the Twelve approve.
1112	And of this token, the Twelve approve.

1114	And of this token, the Twelve approve.
1115	And of this token, the Twelve approve.
1116	And with it pledges devotion undying.
1117	And with it pledges faith unmoving.
1118	And with it signifies \x02\x08\x0f\xe4\xe8\x04\x01\xff\x04his\xff\x04her\x03 commitment to provide for \x02\x08\x0f\xe4\xe8\x04\x01\xff\x04his\xff\x04her\x03 partner, no matter the cost.
1119	And with it pledges dedication unyielding.
1120	And with it pledges loyalty untainted.
1121	And with it pledges trust unwavering.
1122	And with it pledges a commitment unbending.
1123	And with it pledges conviction unending.
1124	And so long as these symbols of your shared bond endure, none may deny the legitimacy of the rites performed here this day.
1125	May they be reminded of that journey whenever they gaze upon these sacred bands. Or into each other's eyes. Or at a moogle, for that matter, kupo!
1126	And with that, all that remains now is to seal the pact...
1127	...with a kiss\xe2\x94\x80amongst other things, kupo!
1128	With this exchange, these two souls shall pledge themselves to one another, and in the eyes of the Twelve be ever joined in one unbroken circle.
1129	Now, \x02,\x0d\xff\x07\x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x02\x03\xff\x02 \x02\x03 and \x02,\x0d\xff\x07\x02\x0a\x03\xe8\x03\x03\xff\x02 \x02\x03...
1130	Step forward and complete the rites of ring and cup.
1131	You both made it through in one piece! And that's more than I can say for those bomb-happy goblins I presided over last week, kupo!
1132	You must feel a great weight has been lifted from your shoulders.
1133	And allow me to be the first to offer my personal congratulations.
1134	May they live happily ever after, kupo!
1135	May the Twelve watch over them forever and always.
1136	The world may not have changed, but from this day forth, nothing will ever be the same.
1137	The Exchanging of Vows\x02\x10\x01\x03The hosts may ring their eternity bells to proceed.
1138	But you cannot stay here, kupo!
1139	We thank you one and all for accompanying us on these first steps of a fabulous new journey.
1140	Thank you all once again for serving as witnesses to this bonding of souls.
1141	I hope to see neither of you again...if you know what I mean, kupo!
1142	Today was the first step in a never-ending journey.
1143	You have endured much and more as individuals to arrive at this day.
